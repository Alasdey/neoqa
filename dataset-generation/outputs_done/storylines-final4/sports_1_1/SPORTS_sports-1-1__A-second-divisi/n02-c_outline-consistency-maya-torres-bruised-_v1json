      "The injury occurred in the second quarter with 3:12 remaining on the clock, as Rivergate Rivets trailed the Midland Mavericks 34\u201128.",
      "Medical staff at Rivergate Sports Complex evaluated Maya Torres\u2019s ankle and diagnosed a grade\u2011I contusion, prescribing rest and limited court time for a minimum of two weeks.",
      "Team physician Dr. Lina Ortiz performed a bedside ultrasound that confirmed no ligament tear and applied an ice compress and compression wrap before sending Maya Torres to the on\u2011site physiotherapy suite.",
      "Coach Dana Loris of Rivergate Rivets Women\u2019s Basketball Club announced that Maya Torres will have playing minutes limited to twelve per quarter for the remainder of the season\u2019s opening month.",
      "The twelve\u2011minute cap per quarter translates to a maximum of 48 minutes per game, and the coaching staff will track Maya Torres\u2019s workload using the club\u2019s wearable GPS and heart\u2011rate monitors.",
      "Coach Dana Loris decided not to activate rookie reserve Leila Kade, a recent graduate of Rivergate Academy of Sports, keeping Leila Kade on the bench despite the reduced minutes for Maya Torres.",
      "Leila Kade, a 5\u2011foot\u20119 point guard who averaged 4.2 points and 2.1 assists in her final academy season, remains on the active roster and will continue to practice with the first\u2011team unit while awaiting a potential debut.",
