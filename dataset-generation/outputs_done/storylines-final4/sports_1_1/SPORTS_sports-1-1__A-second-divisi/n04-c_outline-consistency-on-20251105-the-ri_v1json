An outline describing the next fictional event:\n<outline>\n{{STORYITEM_XML}}\n</outline>\n\nFollow these steps to complete your task:\n\n1. Carefully compare the events described in the outline with the events from the history. Look for any inconsistencies or contradictions.\n\n2. Compare the named entities described in the outline with the list of provided named entities. Ensure they are consistent.\n\n3. Note that changes to known named entities are acceptable if they are reasonably discussed within the outline.\n\n4. If you find any inconsistencies or contradictions:\n   a. Make minimal changes to the outline to resolve the issues.\n   b. Ensure your changes maintain the original structure and flow of the outline as much as possible.\n   c. Double-check after fixing the inconsistencies to ensure they no longer persist.\n\n5. If the outline is consistent with the provided list of entities and previous events (i.e., not contradictory), output the outline without any changes.\n\nPresent your results in the following format:\n\n<results>\n<scratchpad>\n[Your reasoning process, including any inconsistencies found and how you resolved them]\n</scratchpad>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[First story item from the outline, corrected if necessary]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Second story item from the outline, corrected if necessary]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional story items as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nImportant reminders:\n- Always refer to named entities using their full name as described by the \"name\" property.\n- Remember that all events are fictional but should sound plausible and realistic.\n- Your output must include all storyitems, whether you had adjusted them or not.\n- Do not add new events or significantly alter the plot. Your task is to ensure consistency, not to rewrite the story.\n\nIf you cannot resolve an inconsistency without significantly changing the plot, note this in your scratchpad and leave the story item as is, highlighting the inconsistency.\n\nBegin your analysis now, and provide your results in the format specified above.",
