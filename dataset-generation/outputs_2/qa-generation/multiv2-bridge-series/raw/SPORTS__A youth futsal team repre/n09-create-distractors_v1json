players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S29</id><text>Some coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone scanned or photographed selected layouts from the feature series and shared them within small staff

cones.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S14</id><text>During the ball-control segment on 2025-07-03, captain Mikel Ardan and flank player Sera Noll were asked by head coach Marlen Tiravo to demonstrate a

the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo set up the portable goals so that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 could perform relaxed finishing exercises with minimal defensive pressure and an emphasis on clean technique.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S19</id><text>For the finishing drills on 2025-07-03, the two portable goals were placed about nine meters from the end lines on opposite sides of the court, and Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players worked in pairs combining a wall pass and a controlled first touch before shooting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo encouraged the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players to alternate between dominant and weaker feet during the finishing segment and frequently stopped sequences to praise composed body shape or a well-placed low shot into the corners.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S21</id><text>At a brief pause before the last exercise block on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo told the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 that pressing drills and transition games would be deliberately postponed until the following week so that the team could first adjust to the new equipment.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S22</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the squad gathered around, head coach Marlen

players to nod in agreement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S23</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also reminded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the pause that the concepts from the recent \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d article would still be part of the upcoming training cycle, but that 2025-07-03 was intended as a technical reset rather than an intense tactical session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S24</id><text>Toward the end of the 2025-07-03 training, goalkeeper Ren Talvek completed a short series of catching and distribution routines with the new futsal

short block of work on 2025-07-03 included sets of low driven shots along the floor, high looping balls dropped from head coach Marlen Tiravo\u2019s hands, and side-arm throws toward marked zones near the touchline to test both handling and passing range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S26</id><text>After one sequence in which a shot skimmed off his gloves, goalkeeper Ren Talvek commented to head coach Marlen Tiravo that the new futsal balls felt \u201ca touch livelier off the surface\u201d than the previous batch, and the pair briefly discussed adjusting his stance for low

players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll emphasized to Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that the goal of the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 was to

twos.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S6</id><text>During the pre-match warm-up on 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 ran their first on-court version of a paired pressing shadow drill

players worked in twos along the halfway line, sliding sideways in unison to close imaginary passing lanes while coach Harven Soll shouted cues such as \u201cstep and cover\u201d and \u201cshow outside\u201d from just inside the center circle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S8</id><text>The overall warm-up for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 lasted about 18 minutes and combined the new shadow

the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S11</id><text>Although the score remained 0\u20130 before halftime, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 managed three shots on target compared with one clear chance for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, whose close-range effort was beaten away at the near post by the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S12</id><text>Early in the second half on 2025-07-12, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when a

from a retreating Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender, Talen Priev opened his body and slid a left-footed finish inside the near post, drawing loud applause from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 supporters on the bleachers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S18</id><text>Throughout the second half on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll noted from the bench that the back line of Meadowlane School

Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S19</id><text>From his seat on the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 bench, coach Harven Soll periodically scribbled arrows and short comments on a clipboard,

the season.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S21</id><text>After the final whistle of the 1\u20131 draw on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll told the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a brief huddle that the Pressing in Pairs-oriented work had improved the defensive shape of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 still needed to react faster to long diagonal passes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S22</id><text>The post-match huddle for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 formed near the center circle, with the players standing in a tight semicircle around coach Harven Soll, sweat-soaked bibs pulled over their school jerseys as they listened quietly to the feedback.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S23</id><text>Coach Harven Soll singled out one late Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attack that had exposed the far-post area, telling Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that upcoming sessions would focus on getting the weak-side defender to drop earlier whenever the opponent shaped to play a diagonal switch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S24</id><text>Following the post-match team talk on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll and visiting coach Deren

test the new pressing structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S25</id><text>While players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 shook hands and gathered scattered

Deren Kavos remarked to coach Harven Soll that the adjusted pressing of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had forced Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into more long passes than usual, and both

Harven Soll updated the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to schedule Pressing in Pairs-based defensive blocks twice a week in the remaining July sessions for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 before the school league begins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S28</id><text>At a kitchen table in the Meadowlane Quarter that evening, coach Harven Soll spread out the Meadowlane School

Futsal Club Under-17 arrived at Northline Community Sports Hall in Selvarin City for a scheduled full-length pre-season futsal rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S1</id><text>Both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 reached Northline Community Sports Hall shortly after 15:30 by a mix of school minibus and parent cars, aiming for a 16:00 kick-off within a 90-minute booking window.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S2</id><text>Northline Community Sports Hall offered a single full-size futsal court marked on light grey synthetic flooring under a high arched roof, with a small two-row bleacher section along one touchline where a handful of early-arriving parents took seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S3</id><text>Shortly after Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began changing at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos noticed a steady leak in the roof dripping onto one end of the futsal court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S4</id><text>The leak at Northline Community Sports Hall was first noticed when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 substitute heard drops hitting the floor near the far goalmouth and called coach Deren Kavos over while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were still pulling on their socks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S5</id><text>Within a few minutes, a palm-sized wet patch had formed just inside the penalty area line at one end of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, with water steadily dripping from a seam in the metal roof despite the hall attendant placing a plastic bucket nearby.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S6</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked the playing area at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed that the wet patch and spreading moisture made a standard forty-minute futsal match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 unsafe.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S7</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked slowly from sideline to sideline at Northline Community Sports Hall, testing the surface with the soles of their trainers and noting that the damp section already extended roughly four meters into the playing area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S8</id><text>After briefly consulting the hall attendant at Northline Community Sports Hall about the likelihood of the leak stopping and hearing that it had been a recurring issue during recent rain showers, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos concluded that any full-speed sprints toward that goal would pose too much risk of slipping.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos decided to mark off the damp third of the floor at Northline Community Sports Hall with cones and to shorten the available playing space so that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could still complete a controlled training session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S10</id><text>Using a set of bright orange flat cones brought by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and yellow dome cones from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos created a clear no-entry zone that effectively shortened the court to about two-thirds of its normal length at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S11</id><text>While coach Harven Soll quickly crossed out his planned full-match structure in his notebook and jotted down revised timings for drill blocks, coach Deren Kavos explained to a small cluster of puzzled players that the session at Northline Community Sports Hall would emphasize decision-making and pressing rather than match intensity.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S12</id><text>Before starting any ball work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 carried out a joint warm-up on the dry half of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, focusing on light mobility exercises and simple two-player passing patterns.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S13</id><text>The joint warm-up at Northline Community Sports Hall lasted around 15 minutes and began with slow jogging, hip-openers, ankle rolls, and arm swings led by coach Harven Soll before coach Deren Kavos introduced short side shuffles and gentle backward skips.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S14</id><text>After the mobility work at Northline Community Sports Hall, the two coaches paired players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 together in five-meter channels along the sideline to exchange firm right-foot and left-foot passes while calling each other\u2019s names to encourage communication.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S15</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos set up a camera identified as a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a fixed tripod at midcourt in Northline Community Sports Hall to record joint paired-pressing drills by Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 based on concepts from the article Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S16</id><text>The Ravelin VX-2 camcorder belonged to Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and had been brought to Northline Community Sports Hall in a padded black case, with coach Deren Kavos checking that the battery indicator was full and that a 32-gigabyte memory card provided enough space for the afternoon\u2019s work.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S17</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos positioned the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder at midcourt atop the second row of the bleachers at Northline Community Sports Hall, angling the lens slightly downward so the frame captured the entire dry half and the touchline along which the presses would be directed.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S18</id><text>In the main training block, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 mixed players into two balanced squads and ran repeated short sequences in which the first and second defender executed Pressing in Pairs cues toward the sideline while the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder captured every repetition.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S19</id><text>The mixed squads at Northline Community Sports Hall were balanced so that each included two regular defenders, two attackers, and a goalkeeper from across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, with colored bibs used to distinguish the sides regardless of school kit.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S20</id><text>During the main training block at Northline Community Sports Hall, sequences typically lasted 6 to 8 seconds as two defenders snapped into a coordinated press against three circulating attackers, after which coach Harven Soll or coach Deren Kavos would briefly freeze the play to reposition body angles or remind players of the \u201cstep and cover\u201d cue before restarting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S21</id><text>To conclude the on-court work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 played a single twelve-minute mixed-squad training game on the reduced court at Northline Community Sports Hall with informal rules that rewarded successful paired presses instead of keeping a formal score.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S22</id><text>For the twelve-minute mixed-squad training game at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches dubbed the teams \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cGreen\u201d based on bib color and instructed the players that each successful paired press in the attacking half earning a clear turnover would count as one point, even though no official scoreboard was used.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S23</id><text>To reduce physical strain on the shortened court at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches agreed on roll-on substitutions and relaxed restart rules, allowing quick kick-ins from the sidelines so that the flow of play remained centered on creating and responding to pressing situations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S24</id><text>After the session, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos reviewed a brief segment of the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder footage on the camera screen at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed to share the full recording between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 for a joint video-review meeting the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S25</id><text>After the final whistle at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos gathered near the tripod and replayed a 30-second clip in which a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arrived late as the second presser, using the pause button on the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to highlight spacing issues to the small group of nearby players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S26</id><text>Coach Harven Soll offered to copy the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder file from Northline Community Sports Hall onto a portable USB drive and to upload a version to a shared online folder so that both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could access the footage during the joint review planned for the middle of the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S27</id><text>Before leaving Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Deren Kavos and coach Harven Soll confirmed a new date in early August for a full rematch between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, explaining the revised plan to the assembled players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S28</id><text>In confirming the rearranged match at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos suggested an early-evening weekday slot in the first full week of August so that parents could attend after work, and coach Harven Soll checked his paper planner before nodding and noting the time beside the new fixture entry.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S29</id><text>As the players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered around at Northline Community Sports Hall to hear the explanation, several expressed disappointment at missing out on a full match that day, but both coaches stressed that the safer surface and additional video preparation would help make the

video-review session began shortly after 18:30, with around twenty players and the two head coaches filing into a rectangular room furnished with three rows of plastic chairs facing a pull-down projection screen.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S2</id><text>The windows of the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room were tilted open to the warm summer air, and a faint echo of ball sounds from the main court nearby could be heard as the players settled into mixed groups rather than sitting strictly by team.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S3</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 connected the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to a ceiling-mounted Trinovar Castline P7 projector in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to display the 2025-07-24 training footage.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S4</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 used a short black HDMI cable to link the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to the Trinovar Castline P7 projector input panel, then dimmed the room lights so the footage appeared as a clear, wall-filling image near the far end of the meeting room.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S5</id><text>On the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder menu, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had already bookmarked four key clips by timestamp, allowing quick jumps between pressing sequences and build-up examples from the 2025-07-24 session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S6</id><text>Before starting the playback, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17

perspectives.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S7</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 added that the evening was \u201cnot about blaming anyone on the screen, but about learning what our next decisions should look like,\u201d prompting several players from both squads to nod and shift forward in their seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S8</id><text>A few Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players quietly opened small spiral notebooks on their laps as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 spoke, ready to jot down any cues or passing patterns that might be useful in the August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to watch an early clip where Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 applied a sideline press and to focus on the body angles of the second defender.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S10</id><text>The selected clip from the 2025-07-24 recording showed a Blue-bibbed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arriving slightly square to the touchline on the right side, and coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 replayed the five-second action twice so everyone could see how that angle affected the trap.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S11</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pointed toward the projected image with the cap of his marker and asked the mixed group whether the second defender\u2019s front foot should be pointing more toward the ball or more toward the center, inviting short, one-word answers from the front row.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S12</id><text>During a paused frame of the same sequence, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 used a whiteboard in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to sketch the ideal positions for the first and second defender in the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S13</id><text>On the whiteboard, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 drew a simplified half-court diagram with small crosses for defenders, circles for attackers, and a bold arrow showing the first defender\u2019s pressing run toward the sideline while the second defender staggered half a step behind and slightly inside.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S14</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 wrote \u201c1.5 steps gap\u201d and \u201cbody half-open\u201d beside the second defender\u2019s symbol, explaining that this spacing allowed quick cover if the opponent cut inside or played a bounce pass back toward the middle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S15</id><text>In a later segment of the video, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 highlighted a passage where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 struggled to build out from the back against the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 press and invited Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to suggest alternative passing options.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S16</id><text>The paused scene showed the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper holding the ball with both flank options tightly marked and a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 forward closing in, and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 asked whether a quick diagonal pass to the pivot between the lines or a wall pass off the near defender would have been safer.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S17</id><text>One Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender raised a hand and suggested that a pre-agreed rotation, with the far-side defender stepping into the middle as a third option, could have created a clearer passing lane against the two-player press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S18</id><text>The goalkeepers from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 sat together in the front row while coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 replayed short goal-throw sequences to discuss

on his knees, occasionally jotting single words such as \u201cquick start\u201d and \u201clook weak side\u201d on a small notepad as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 paused and rewound individual throws.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S20</id><text>On one freeze-frame, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 traced an imaginary passing line across the bottom of the projected image, explaining to both goalkeepers how an early release toward the side opposite the incoming paired press could bypass two defenders before they locked the line.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S21</id><text>Midway through the session, a brief break at the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room allowed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest

out beside a stack of napkins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S23</id><text>During the five-minute pause, small mixed groups of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players chatted quietly about the toughest pressing drills from 2025-07-24 and compared who would likely start in the upcoming August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S24</id><text>In the final discussion block, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 jointly wrote three agreed verbal cues\u2014\u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d\u2014on the Varlen Crest Training Hall whiteboard as shared terminology for the upcoming August rematch at Varlen Crest Training

Club Under-17 added a short explanation next to each, such as \u201clock line = no pass between us and the ball\u201d to make the meaning clear for both squads.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S26</id><text>Several players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 quickly took photos of the whiteboard on their phones after being encouraged by coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 to use the cues as standard language in their next team training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 handed the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players photocopied pages from the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly article \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress, marked with notes to apply specific drills in the next two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S28</id><text>On the photocopied pages, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had highlighted several paragraphs in

directing both squads toward the main court changing rooms.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S2</id><text>As the players unpacked boots and shin pads, a low hum from the hall\u2019s ventilation system and the squeak of another group finishing a prior booking set the backdrop for informal greetings and brief reminders from staff that this fixture replaced the abandoned match at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S3</id><text>The match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 kicked off at approximately 18:05 on the main court of

rematch.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S5</id><text>Roughly 40 to 50 spectators, including parents, siblings, and a few teammates from younger age groups, took seats along the sideline bleachers as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 in dark blue and Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in white and green lined up for the ceremonial handshakes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S6</id><text>In the 11th minute at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when winger Narel Vossin finished a fast counterattack with a low right-footed shot.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S7</id><text>The move began when a loose square pass from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near halfway was picked off and quickly shifted into a two-on-one break down the right, allowing Narel Vossin to cut inside onto his stronger foot before driving the ball across goalkeeper Riven Hall into the far corner.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S8</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 bench sprang to its feet as the electronic scoreboard flipped to 1\u20130, while two Meadowlane School Futsal

cover\u201d press and scored from just inside the penalty area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S10</id><text>The equalizer arrived in the 18th minute when Talen Priev jumped a lateral pass near the left touchline, took one steadying touch inward, and snapped a low right-footed shot just inside the near post before the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could fully set his feet.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S11</id><text>As the ball hit the net, several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players shouted \u201clock line\u201d in unison, and coach Harven Soll quickly pointed to the pressing pair involved in the turnover, giving them a thumbs-up from the technical area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S12</id><text>Midway through the second half at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 went 2\u20131 ahead of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 midfielder Kelan Muvir converted a rebound from close range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S13</id><text>The decisive goal followed a firmly struck mid-range effort that the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could only parry into the middle of the area, where late-arriving midfielder Kelan Muvir reacted quickest to side-foot the loose ball in from around three meters out.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S14</id><text>Kelan Muvir wheeled away toward the corner with both arms raised before being surrounded by teammates, while referee Javren Mesk calmly signaled for the restart as the scoreboard ticked past the 10-minute mark of the second half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S15</id><text>Throughout both halves at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 consistently used the shared verbal cues \u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d to organize pressing actions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S16</id><text>The calls were loud enough that spectators could often hear entire pressing sequences being choreographed in real time, with the two coaches occasionally reinforcing a cue from the sidelines when a player hesitated between jumping to the ball or tucking in.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S17</id><text>On more than one occasion both teams shouted the same word at once during a contested build-up, drawing a brief ripple of amusement from the benches before attention snapped back to the ball.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S18</id><text>During the rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin operated a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a midcourt tripod to record the full match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S19</id><text>Selko Marin positioned the tripod on the first row of the central bleacher section near halfway, adjusted the zoom to capture both penalty areas, and checked that the red recording light stayed on as the match moved into its opening exchanges.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S20</id><text>During short stoppages, Selko Marin quietly noted goal times and a few key pressing situations on a folded sheet of paper so that coaches could later jump directly to those segments in the recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S21</id><text>After the final whistle confirming the 2\u20131 win for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 over Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, coach Harven Soll gathered Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near one goal at Varlen Crest Training Hall to praise the composure shown after falling behind.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S22</id><text>Standing just inside the penalty area, coach Harven Soll told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that \u201cwe stayed with our plan instead of chasing the game,\u201d highlighting how the equalizer and winner had both come from moments that began with disciplined pressing rather than rushed individual runs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S23</id><text>Several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players knelt to loosen their boots and stretch calves as they listened, sweat still dripping onto the wooden floor while they exchanged quick pats on the back and quiet congratulations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S24</id><text>In a separate post-match huddle at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos told Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 that Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had improved its pressing coordination against Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but needed sharper decision-making in possession.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S25</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos pointed to a late sequence where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 forced Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into a corner but then gave the ball away with a hurried diagonal pass, using it as an example of winning the press but not valuing the next touch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S26</id><text>A few Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players asked short questions about when to recycle through the goalkeeper or pivot under pressure, and coach Deren Kavos replied that these moments would be the main focus of the next week\u2019s training blocks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed to use the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder recording for a shorter follow-up joint video-review session later in August.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S28</id><text>Leaning over the edge of the court with their notebooks and phones out, the two coaches tentatively penciled in a midweek 45-minute slot before the start of the school league, agreeing that they would limit the session to a handful of key clips on pressing and build-out choices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S29</id><text>Selko Marin confirmed to both coaches that the full match file would be backed up onto an external drive that evening and exported into a shareable

around 18:15 on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll gathered twelve Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players on the indoor court of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in the Meadowlane Quarter of Selvarin City for an evening training session focused on defensive pressing.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S1</id><text>The group for the 2025-08-10 session included goalkeeper Riven Hall, winger Talen Priev, and midfielder Kelan Muvir, with the side doors of the warm, slightly echoing gym propped open to let in cooler evening air while the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S2</id><text>Coach Harven Soll had marked the training slot in his paper planner as an extended 18:15\u201319:45 block, telling the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players as they jogged in from the corridor that the entire 90 minutes would revolve around sharpening pressing habits from the recent 2\u20131 rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S3</id><text>Before the warm-up, coach Harven Soll used a school laptop connected to a portable projector to queue several short clips from the recent 2\u20131 match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, using video that Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin had exported from the original Ravelin VX-2 camcorder recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S4</id><text>The laptop and compact projector were set up on a low folding table at one end of the court, projecting the footage onto a blank section of the pale wall while audio played through the laptop\u2019s small speakers so that the crowd noise and shouted cues from Varlen Crest Training Hall were just audible over the hum of the ventilation system.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S5</id><text>The video file provided by staff member Selko Marin was organized into several bookmarked segments labeled with approximate match timestamps, allowing coach Harven Soll to jump directly to pressing situations from the first and second halves without having to scrub blindly through the full recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S6</id><text>Once the equipment was ready, coach Harven Soll told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that the goal of the 2025-08-10 session was to walk slowly through the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d structure from the article Pressing in Pairs using clips from Varlen Crest Training Hall before the upcoming joint video-review at Varlen Crest Training Hall with Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 coach Deren Kavos.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S7</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the projector glow behind him, coach Harven Soll asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players\u2014seated in a loose semicircle on the floor\u2014to treat the evening as \u201ca moving classroom,\u201d pointing toward a stack of photocopied Pressing in Pairs pages resting on the bench and reminding them that the joint review with coach Deren Kavos was expected to fall in the final week before the school league kicked off.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S8</id><text>In the first video segment on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll paused a clip of a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sideline press that had opened up in the middle and instructed four Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players to stand in the same positions on the court that appeared on the frozen image from Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S9</id><text>The paused clip came from an early first-half sequence in which Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had pressed down the right flank, and coach Harven Soll called out Talen Priev, Kelan Muvir, and two regular defenders by name to jog into the exact spots shown on the screen while the rest of the squad watched from the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S10</id><text>To help the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players match their spacing precisely, coach Harven Soll dropped four flat cones at their feet, adjusting each cone by a few centimeters as he compared the live positions to the frozen image of Varlen Crest Training Hall on the wall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S11</id><text>With the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players holding those positions, coach Harven Soll used a small whiteboard beside the court to sketch the same scene, labeling the first and second defender in line with the terminology from Pressing in Pairs and underlining the cue phrase \u201cstep and cover.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S12</id><text>Coach Harven Soll used a red marker to draw the first defender and a blue marker for the second defender, adding black arrows to show the ideal shuffle path and a small shaded box to represent the central space that had been left exposed in the original action.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S13</id><text>After finishing the rough diagram, coach Harven Soll turned the whiteboard toward the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and asked the four on-court demonstrators whether the sketched distances matched how the situation had felt in the game, prompting a brief discussion about how far the second defender should have tucked inside.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S14</id><text>In the next clip that coach Harven Soll chose from the Varlen Crest Training Hall recording, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had to drop out of a high press, and coach Harven Soll replayed the five-second sequence three times to emphasize the moment when the \u201creset block\u201d instruction should be called by the back line.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S15</id><text>With the volume turned up, the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players could hear that no one actually shouted \u201creset block\u201d until after Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had already switched the ball to the far side, and coach Harven Soll paused on that frame to ask which defender should take responsibility for giving the early command.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S16</id><text>Coach Harven Soll tapped the projected image where the two deepest Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were visible and suggested that the left-sided defender or, failing that, goalkeeper Riven Hall needed to be the designated voice in such moments so that the whole unit could drop in time.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S17</id><text>After the initial video work on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll divided Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into two groups of five players and asked each group to rehearse a slow-motion \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d walk-through from the halfway line toward a corner without a ball while coach Harven Soll counted their steps aloud.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S18</id><text>The remaining two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players, including goalkeeper Riven Hall, initially observed from just outside the touchline before rotating into the patterns on the second and third repetitions so that every player practiced both the first and second defender roles.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S19</id><text>As each group shuffled from the halfway line toward the wall, coach Harven Soll counted \u201cone\u201d through \u201ceight\u201d in a firm voice, stopping the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pairs if they had not reached the imagined trap line by the sixth step and nudging them a little closer together with his hands.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S20</id><text>During a later block of the 2025-08-10 session, coach Harven Soll placed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall in front of one goal and arranged cones to represent Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attackers so that Riven Hall could practice goal throws aimed at spaces that a coordinated \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d press would be likely to leave open.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S21</id><text>The cones in front of goalkeeper Riven Hall were set out in two staggered lines in red and yellow, mirroring the typical positions of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17\u2019s pivot and wide players, with a clear channel left to the weak side that coach Harven Soll identified as the preferred target area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S22</id><text>In sets of a dozen repetitions, coach Harven Soll called out cues such as \u201cweak side\u201d or \u201cearly bounce,\u201d timing how quickly goalkeeper Riven Hall could collect an imaginary back-pass and deliver a firm, accurate throw into the designated corridor behind the simulated press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S23</id><text>To conclude the on-court segment on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll instructed every Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 player to select one key phrase from Pressing in Pairs, such as \u201clock line\u201d or \u201creset block,\u201d and to call out that phrase each time the player stepped into a pressing action during a final five-minute shadow pressing sequence.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S24</id><text>Some Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players chose the more descriptive cues that coach Harven Soll had written on the whiteboard earlier, shouting words like \u201cbody half-open\u201d or \u201cprotect middle\u201d as they moved, so that the court was filled with overlapping calls every time a pair slid into position.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S25</id><text>During the last minute of the shadow pressing sequence, the synchronized movements and sharp verbal cues from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players echoed off the high ceiling, drawing a curious glance from a school caretaker wheeling a trolley past the open doorway.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S26</id><text>After the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players left the indoor court on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll remained at Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to re-watch two Varlen Crest Training Hall clips on the laptop, adding detailed notes in his planning notebook that coach Harven Soll intended to share with Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 coach Deren Kavos ahead of the late-August joint review at Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S27</id><text>In his planning notebook, coach Harven Soll wrote down precise timestamps and short headings such as \u201c14:32 \u2013 late second cover, middle open\u201d and \u201c21:05 \u2013 Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 escape via pivot rotation,\u201d underlining a few questions he wanted to ask coach Deren Kavos about Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17\u2019s build-out decisions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S28</id><text>Coach Harven Soll finally closed the laptop and switched off the portable projector shortly before 20:00, locking the equipment cupboard at Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and slipping the annotated notebook into his bag so that it would be ready for the upcoming joint session at Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-08-22</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N8-S0</id><text>On 2025-08-22, coach Harven Soll began an after-school training session for Meadowlane

cue.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll ran each small-sided pressing round for three-minute bursts using the wall-mounted clock as a guide, rotating the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 groups between attack and defense so that every player repeatedly practiced both roles in the paired press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S6</id><text>During one small-sided pressing

2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo organized Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 into small groups for individual ball-control stations that emphasized toe-touches, rolls, and turns using the new futsal balls supplied by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S13</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo divided the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players into three groups

middle phase of the 2025-07-03 practice, fitness coach Kelran Dov led Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 through low-intensity agility patterns over the new ladders and mini-hurdles to reintroduce

the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo set up the portable goals so that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 could perform relaxed finishing exercises with minimal defensive pressure and an emphasis on clean technique.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S19</id><text>For the finishing drills on 2025-07-03, the two portable goals were placed about nine meters from the end lines on opposite sides of the court, and Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players worked in pairs combining a wall pass and a controlled first touch before shooting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo encouraged the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players to alternate between dominant and weaker feet during the finishing segment and frequently stopped sequences to praise composed body shape or a well-placed low shot into the corners.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S21</id><text>At a brief pause before the last exercise block on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo told the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 that pressing drills and transition games would be deliberately postponed until the following week so that the team could first adjust to the new equipment.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S22</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the squad gathered around, head coach Marlen

players to nod in agreement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S23</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also reminded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the pause that the concepts from the recent \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d article would still be part of the upcoming training cycle, but that 2025-07-03 was intended as a technical reset rather than an intense tactical session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S24</id><text>Toward the end of the 2025-07-03 training, goalkeeper Ren Talvek completed a short series of catching and distribution routines with the new futsal balls under the guidance of head coach Marlen Tiravo to assess the bounce and grip for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S25</id><text>Goalkeeper Ren Talvek\u2019s short block of work on 2025-07-03 included sets of low driven shots along the floor, high looping balls dropped from head coach Marlen Tiravo\u2019s hands, and side-arm throws toward marked zones near the touchline to test both handling and passing range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S26</id><text>After one sequence in which a shot skimmed off his gloves, goalkeeper Ren Talvek commented to head coach Marlen Tiravo that the new futsal balls felt \u201ca touch livelier off the surface\u201d than the previous batch, and the pair briefly discussed adjusting his stance for low saves.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S27</id><text>After the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo sent a brief email from the office of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy to development coordinator

Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S4</id><text>The pre-match meeting for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 took place in a narrow changing room beside the indoor court, where coach Harven Soll

players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll emphasized to Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that the goal of the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 was to

twos.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S6</id><text>During the pre-match warm-up on 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 ran their first on-court version of a paired pressing shadow drill adapted from Pressing in Pairs under the direct supervision of coach Harven Soll.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S7</id><text>In the paired pressing shadow drill, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players worked in twos along the halfway line, sliding sideways in unison to close imaginary passing lanes while coach Harven Soll shouted cues such as \u201cstep and cover\u201d and \u201cshow outside\u201d from just inside the center circle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S8</id><text>The overall warm-up for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 lasted about 18 minutes and combined the new shadow pressing movements with a brief four-versus-one rondo and a short shooting sequence before Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began its own preparations on the opposite half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S9</id><text>In the opening half of the 2025-07-12 friendly, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 kept the score 0\u20130 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 repeatedly used two-player presses to force the ball toward the sidelines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S10</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 set up in a 2\u20132 defensive shape for most of the first half and repeatedly angled pressure toward the left sideline, funneling Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into rushed passes that rolled harmlessly over the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S11</id><text>Although the score remained 0\u20130 before halftime, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 managed three shots on target compared with one clear chance for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, whose close-range effort was beaten away at the near post by the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S12</id><text>Early in the second half on 2025-07-12, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger finished a fast counterattack from the right side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S13</id><text>The opening goal for Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived

counter down the right flank.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S14</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger cut inside toward the edge of the area and drove a firm low shot across Meadowlane

center circle as Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sprung a coordinated press from the left side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S17</id><text>After carrying the ball roughly ten meters under pressure from a retreating Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender, Talen Priev opened his body and slid a left-footed finish inside the near post, drawing loud applause from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 supporters on the bleachers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S18</id><text>Throughout the second half on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll noted from the bench that the back line of Meadowlane School

Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S19</id><text>From his seat on the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 bench, coach Harven Soll periodically scribbled arrows and short comments on a clipboard,

touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S20</id><text>Several times as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 tried to build through the middle, coach Harven Soll pointed toward the top of the penalty area

the season.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S21</id><text>After the final whistle of the 1\u20131 draw on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll told the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a brief huddle that the Pressing in Pairs-oriented work had improved the defensive shape of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 still needed to react faster to long diagonal passes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S22</id><text>The post-match huddle for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 formed near the center circle, with the players standing in a tight semicircle around coach Harven Soll, sweat-soaked bibs pulled over their school jerseys as they listened quietly to the feedback.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S23</id><text>Coach Harven Soll singled out one late Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attack that had exposed the far-post area, telling Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that upcoming sessions would focus on getting the weak-side defender to drop earlier whenever the opponent shaped to play a diagonal switch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S24</id><text>Following the post-match team talk on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll and visiting coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed at courtside that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 would arrange a second friendly later in July to further test the new pressing structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S25</id><text>While players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 shook hands and gathered scattered

Deren Kavos remarked to coach Harven Soll that the adjusted pressing of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had forced Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into more long passes than usual, and both coaches discussed the possibility of recording short video clips of the next friendly for a joint post-game review.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S27</id><text>Later in the evening of 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll updated the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to schedule Pressing in Pairs-based defensive blocks twice a week in the remaining July sessions for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 before the school league begins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S28</id><text>At a kitchen table in the Meadowlane Quarter that evening, coach Harven Soll spread out the Meadowlane School

July.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S29</id><text>In the margin of the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll wrote a reminder to pair the defensive blocks with short

Futsal Club Under-17 arrived at Northline Community Sports Hall in Selvarin City for a scheduled full-length pre-season futsal rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S1</id><text>Both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 reached Northline Community Sports Hall shortly after 15:30 by a mix of school minibus and parent cars, aiming for a 16:00 kick-off within a 90-minute booking window.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S2</id><text>Northline Community Sports Hall offered a single full-size futsal court marked on light grey synthetic flooring under a high arched roof, with a small two-row bleacher section along one touchline where a handful of early-arriving parents took seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S3</id><text>Shortly after Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began changing at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos noticed a steady leak in the roof dripping onto one end of the futsal court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S4</id><text>The leak at Northline Community Sports Hall was first noticed when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 substitute heard drops hitting the floor near the far goalmouth and called coach Deren Kavos over while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were still pulling on their socks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S5</id><text>Within a few minutes, a palm-sized wet patch had formed just inside the penalty area line at one end of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, with water steadily dripping from a seam in the metal roof despite the hall attendant placing a plastic bucket nearby.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S6</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked the playing area at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed that the wet patch and spreading moisture made a standard forty-minute futsal match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 unsafe.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S7</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked slowly from sideline to sideline at Northline Community Sports Hall, testing the surface with the soles of their trainers and noting that the damp section already extended roughly four meters into the playing area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S8</id><text>After briefly consulting the hall attendant at Northline Community Sports Hall about the likelihood of the leak stopping and hearing that it had been a recurring issue during recent rain showers, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos concluded that any full-speed sprints toward that goal would pose too much risk of slipping.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos decided to mark off the damp third of the floor at Northline Community Sports Hall with cones and to shorten the available playing space so that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could still complete a controlled training session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S10</id><text>Using a set of bright orange flat cones brought by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and yellow dome cones from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos created a clear no-entry zone that effectively shortened the court to about two-thirds of its normal length at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S11</id><text>While coach Harven Soll quickly crossed out his planned full-match structure in his notebook and jotted down revised timings for drill blocks, coach Deren Kavos explained to a small cluster of puzzled players that the session at Northline Community Sports Hall would emphasize decision-making and pressing rather than match intensity.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S12</id><text>Before starting any ball work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 carried out a joint warm-up on the dry half of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, focusing on light mobility exercises and simple two-player passing patterns.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S13</id><text>The joint warm-up at Northline Community Sports Hall lasted around 15 minutes and began with slow jogging, hip-openers, ankle rolls, and arm swings led by coach Harven Soll before coach Deren Kavos introduced short side shuffles and gentle backward skips.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S14</id><text>After the mobility work at Northline Community Sports Hall, the two coaches paired players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 together in five-meter channels along the sideline to exchange firm right-foot and left-foot passes while calling each other\u2019s names to encourage communication.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S15</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos set up a camera identified as a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a fixed tripod at midcourt in Northline Community Sports Hall to record joint paired-pressing drills by Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 based on concepts from the article Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S16</id><text>The Ravelin VX-2 camcorder belonged to Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and had been brought to Northline Community Sports Hall in a padded black case, with coach Deren Kavos checking that the battery indicator was full and that a 32-gigabyte memory card provided enough space for the afternoon\u2019s work.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S17</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos positioned the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder at midcourt atop the second row of the bleachers at Northline Community Sports Hall, angling the lens slightly downward so the frame captured the entire dry half and the touchline along which the presses would be directed.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S18</id><text>In the main training block, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 mixed players into two balanced squads and ran repeated short sequences in which the first and second defender executed Pressing in Pairs cues toward the sideline while the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder captured every repetition.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S19</id><text>The mixed squads at Northline Community Sports Hall were balanced so that each included two regular defenders, two attackers, and a goalkeeper from across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, with colored bibs used to distinguish the sides regardless of school kit.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S20</id><text>During the main training block at Northline Community Sports Hall, sequences typically lasted 6 to 8 seconds as two defenders snapped into a coordinated press against three circulating attackers, after which coach Harven Soll or coach Deren Kavos would briefly freeze the play to reposition body angles or remind players of the \u201cstep and cover\u201d cue before restarting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S21</id><text>To conclude the on-court work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 played a single twelve-minute mixed-squad training game on the reduced court at Northline Community Sports Hall with informal rules that rewarded successful paired presses instead of keeping a formal score.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S22</id><text>For the twelve-minute mixed-squad training game at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches dubbed the teams \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cGreen\u201d based on bib color and instructed the players that each successful paired press in the attacking half earning a clear turnover would count as one point, even though no official scoreboard was used.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S23</id><text>To reduce physical strain on the shortened court at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches agreed on roll-on substitutions and relaxed restart rules, allowing quick kick-ins from the sidelines so that the flow of play remained centered on creating and responding to pressing situations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S24</id><text>After the session, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos reviewed a brief segment of the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder footage on the camera screen at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed to share the full recording between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 for a joint video-review meeting the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S25</id><text>After the final whistle at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos gathered near the tripod and replayed a 30-second clip in which a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arrived late as the second presser, using the pause button on the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to highlight spacing issues to the small group of nearby players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S26</id><text>Coach Harven Soll offered to copy the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder file from Northline Community Sports Hall onto a portable USB drive and to upload a version to a shared online folder so that both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could access the footage during the joint review planned for the middle of the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S27</id><text>Before leaving Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Deren Kavos and coach Harven Soll confirmed a new date in early August for a full rematch between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, explaining the revised plan to the assembled players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S28</id><text>In confirming the rearranged match at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos suggested an early-evening weekday slot in the first full week of August so that parents could attend after work, and coach Harven Soll checked his paper planner before nodding and noting the time beside the new fixture entry.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S29</id><text>As the players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered around at Northline Community Sports Hall to hear the explanation, several expressed disappointment at missing out on a full match that day, but both coaches stressed that the safer surface and additional video preparation would help make the

projection screen.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S2</id><text>The windows of the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room were tilted open to the warm summer air, and a faint echo of ball sounds from the main court nearby could be heard as the players settled into mixed groups rather than sitting strictly by team.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S3</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 connected the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to a ceiling-mounted Trinovar Castline P7 projector in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to display the 2025-07-24 training

VX-2 camcorder menu, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had already bookmarked four key clips by timestamp, allowing quick jumps between pressing sequences and build-up examples from the 2025-07-24 session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S6</id><text>Before starting the playback, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players that the main aim of the meeting was to refine shared \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d cues from both defensive and build-up perspectives.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S7</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 added that the evening was \u201cnot about blaming anyone on the screen, but about learning what our next decisions should look like,\u201d prompting several players from both squads to nod and shift forward in their seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S8</id><text>A few Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players quietly opened small spiral notebooks on their laps as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 spoke, ready to jot down any cues or passing patterns that might be useful in the August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to watch an early clip where Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 applied a sideline press and to focus on the body angles of the second defender.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S10</id><text>The selected clip from the 2025-07-24 recording showed a Blue-bibbed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arriving slightly square to the touchline on the right side, and coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 replayed the five-second action twice so everyone could see how that angle affected the trap.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S11</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pointed toward the projected image with the cap of his marker and asked the mixed group whether the second defender\u2019s front foot should be pointing more toward the ball or more toward the center, inviting short, one-word answers from the front row.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S12</id><text>During a paused frame of the same sequence, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 used a whiteboard in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to sketch the ideal positions for the first and second defender in the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S13</id><text>On the whiteboard, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 drew a simplified half-court diagram with small crosses for defenders, circles for attackers, and a bold arrow showing the first defender\u2019s pressing run toward the sideline while the second defender staggered half a step behind and slightly inside.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S14</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 wrote \u201c1.5 steps gap\u201d and \u201cbody half-open\u201d beside the second defender\u2019s symbol, explaining that this spacing allowed quick cover if the opponent cut inside or played a bounce pass back toward the middle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S15</id><text>In a later segment of the video, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 highlighted a passage where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 struggled to build out from the back against the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 press and invited Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to suggest alternative passing options.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S16</id><text>The paused scene showed the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper holding the ball with both flank options tightly marked and a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 forward closing in, and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 asked whether a quick diagonal pass to the pivot between the lines or a wall pass off the near defender would have been safer.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S17</id><text>One Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender raised a hand and suggested that a pre-agreed rotation, with the far-side defender stepping into the middle as a third option, could have created a clearer passing lane against the two-player press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S18</id><text>The goalkeepers from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 sat together in the front row while coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 replayed short goal-throw sequences to discuss

on his knees, occasionally jotting single words such as \u201cquick start\u201d and \u201clook weak side\u201d on a small notepad as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 paused and rewound individual throws.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S20</id><text>On one freeze-frame, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 traced an imaginary passing line across the bottom of the projected image, explaining to both goalkeepers how an early release toward the side opposite the incoming paired press could bypass two defenders before they locked the line.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S21</id><text>Midway through the session, a brief break at the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room allowed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to take water and snacks set out on a side table by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S22</id><text>The refreshments arranged by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin consisted of large plastic jugs of water, paper cups, sliced oranges, and a tray of small cheese-and-vegetable sandwiches laid out beside a stack of napkins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S23</id><text>During the five-minute pause, small mixed groups of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players chatted quietly about the toughest pressing drills from 2025-07-24 and compared who would likely start in the upcoming August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S24</id><text>In the final discussion block, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 jointly wrote three agreed verbal cues\u2014\u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d\u2014on the Varlen Crest Training Hall whiteboard as shared terminology for the upcoming August rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S25</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 printed the three phrases in large capital letters while coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 added a short explanation next to each, such as \u201clock line = no pass between us and the ball\u201d to make the meaning clear for both squads.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S26</id><text>Several players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 quickly took photos of the whiteboard on their phones after being encouraged by coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 to use the cues as standard language in their next team training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 handed the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players photocopied pages from the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly article \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress, marked with notes to apply specific drills in the next two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S28</id><text>On the photocopied pages, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had highlighted several paragraphs in yellow and circled two small-field exercises, writing timings like \u201cTue \u2013 15 min: 3v3 trap in corner\u201d in the margins to signal how they would be inserted into the upcoming schedule.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S29</id><text>As the meeting wrapped up, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players folded the marked handouts into their backpacks, with a few quietly remarking

directing both squads toward the main court changing rooms.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S2</id><text>As the players unpacked boots and shin pads, a low hum from the hall\u2019s ventilation system and the squeak of another group finishing a prior booking set the backdrop for informal greetings and brief reminders from staff that this fixture replaced the abandoned match at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S3</id><text>The match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 kicked off at approximately 18:05 on the main court of

rematch.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S5</id><text>Roughly 40 to 50 spectators, including parents, siblings, and a few teammates from younger age groups, took seats along the sideline bleachers as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 in dark blue and Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in white and green lined up for the ceremonial handshakes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S6</id><text>In the 11th minute at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when winger Narel Vossin finished a fast counterattack with a low right-footed shot.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S7</id><text>The move began when a loose square pass from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near halfway was picked off and quickly shifted into a two-on-one break down the right, allowing Narel Vossin to cut inside onto his stronger foot before driving the ball across goalkeeper Riven Hall into the far corner.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S8</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 bench sprang to its feet as the electronic scoreboard flipped to 1\u20130, while two Meadowlane School Futsal

Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 equalized to 1\u20131 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when wide player Talen Priev intercepted a pass created by a \u201cstep and cover\u201d press and scored from just inside the penalty area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S10</id><text>The equalizer arrived in the 18th minute when Talen Priev jumped a lateral pass near the left touchline, took one steadying touch inward, and snapped a low right-footed shot just inside the near post before the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could fully set his feet.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S11</id><text>As the ball hit the net, several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players shouted \u201clock line\u201d in unison, and coach Harven Soll quickly pointed to the pressing pair involved in the turnover, giving them a thumbs-up from the technical area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S12</id><text>Midway through the second half at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 went 2\u20131 ahead of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 midfielder Kelan Muvir converted a rebound from close range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S13</id><text>The decisive goal followed a firmly struck mid-range effort that the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could only parry into the middle of the area, where late-arriving midfielder Kelan Muvir reacted quickest to side-foot the loose ball in from around three meters out.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S14</id><text>Kelan Muvir wheeled away toward the corner with both arms raised before being surrounded by teammates, while referee Javren Mesk calmly signaled for the restart as the scoreboard ticked past the 10-minute mark of the second half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S15</id><text>Throughout both halves at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 consistently used the shared verbal cues \u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d to organize pressing actions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S16</id><text>The calls were loud enough that spectators could often hear entire pressing sequences being choreographed in real time, with the two coaches occasionally reinforcing a cue from the sidelines when a player hesitated between jumping to the ball or tucking in.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S17</id><text>On more than one occasion both teams shouted the same word at once during a contested build-up, drawing a brief ripple of amusement from the benches before attention snapped back to the ball.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S18</id><text>During the rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin operated a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a midcourt tripod to record the full match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S19</id><text>Selko Marin positioned the tripod on the first row of the central bleacher section near halfway, adjusted the zoom to capture both penalty areas, and checked that the red recording light stayed on as the match moved into its opening exchanges.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S20</id><text>During short stoppages, Selko Marin quietly noted goal times and a few key pressing situations on a folded sheet of paper so that coaches could later jump directly to those segments in the recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S21</id><text>After the final whistle confirming the 2\u20131 win for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 over Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, coach Harven Soll gathered Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near one goal at Varlen Crest Training Hall to praise the composure shown after falling behind.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S22</id><text>Standing just inside the penalty area, coach Harven Soll told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that \u201cwe stayed with our plan instead of chasing the game,\u201d highlighting how the equalizer and winner had both come from moments that began with disciplined pressing rather than rushed individual runs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S23</id><text>Several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players knelt to loosen their boots and stretch calves as they listened, sweat still dripping onto the wooden floor while they exchanged quick pats on the back and quiet congratulations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S24</id><text>In a separate post-match huddle at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos told Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 that Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had improved its pressing coordination against Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but needed sharper decision-making in possession.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S25</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos pointed to a late sequence where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 forced Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into a corner but then gave the ball away with a hurried diagonal pass, using it as an example of winning the press but not valuing the next touch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S26</id><text>A few Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players asked short questions about when to recycle through the goalkeeper or pivot under pressure, and coach Deren Kavos replied that these moments would be the main focus of the next week\u2019s training blocks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed to use the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder recording for a shorter follow-up joint video-review session later in August.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S28</id><text>Leaning over the edge of the court with their notebooks and phones out, the two coaches tentatively penciled in a midweek 45-minute slot before the start of the school league, agreeing that they would limit the session to a handful of key clips on pressing and build-out choices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S29</id><text>Selko Marin confirmed to both coaches that the full match file would be backed up onto an external drive that evening and exported into a shareable

around 18:15 on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll gathered twelve Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players on the indoor court of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in the Meadowlane Quarter of Selvarin City for an evening training session focused on defensive pressing.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S1</id><text>The group for the 2025-08-10 session included goalkeeper Riven Hall, winger Talen Priev, and midfielder Kelan Muvir, with the side doors of the warm, slightly echoing gym propped open to let in cooler evening air while the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S2</id><text>Coach Harven Soll had marked the training slot in his paper planner as an extended 18:15\u201319:45 block, telling the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players as they jogged in from the corridor that the entire 90 minutes would revolve around sharpening pressing habits from the recent 2\u20131 rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S3</id><text>Before the warm-up, coach Harven Soll used a school laptop connected to a portable projector to queue several short clips from the recent 2\u20131 match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, using video that Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin had exported from the original Ravelin VX-2 camcorder recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S4</id><text>The laptop and compact projector were set up on a low folding table at one end of the court, projecting the footage onto a blank section of the pale wall while audio played through the laptop\u2019s small speakers so that the crowd noise and shouted cues from Varlen Crest Training Hall were just audible over the hum of the ventilation system.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S5</id><text>The video file provided by staff member Selko Marin was organized into several bookmarked segments labeled with approximate match timestamps, allowing coach Harven Soll to jump directly to pressing situations from the first and second halves without having to scrub blindly through the full recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S6</id><text>Once the equipment was ready, coach Harven Soll told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that the goal of the 2025-08-10 session was to walk slowly through the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d structure from the article Pressing in Pairs using clips from Varlen Crest Training Hall before the upcoming joint video-review at Varlen Crest Training Hall with Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 coach Deren Kavos.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S7</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the projector glow behind him, coach Harven Soll asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players\u2014seated in a loose semicircle on the floor\u2014to treat the evening as \u201ca moving classroom,\u201d pointing toward a stack of photocopied Pressing in Pairs pages resting on the bench and reminding them that the joint review with coach Deren Kavos was expected to fall in the final week before the school league kicked off.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S8</id><text>In the first video segment on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll paused a clip of a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sideline press that had opened up in the middle and instructed four Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players to stand in the same positions on the court that appeared on the frozen image from Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S9</id><text>The paused clip came from an early first-half sequence in which Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had pressed down the right flank, and coach Harven Soll called out Talen Priev, Kelan Muvir, and two regular defenders by name to jog into the exact spots shown on the screen while the rest of the squad watched from the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S10</id><text>To help the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players match their spacing precisely, coach Harven Soll dropped four flat cones at their feet, adjusting each cone by a few centimeters as he compared the live positions to the frozen image of Varlen Crest Training Hall on the wall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S11</id><text>With the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players holding those positions, coach Harven Soll used a small whiteboard beside the court to sketch the same scene, labeling the first and second defender in line with the terminology from Pressing in Pairs and underlining the cue phrase \u201cstep and cover.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S12</id><text>Coach Harven Soll used a red marker to draw the first defender and a blue marker for the second defender, adding black arrows to show the ideal shuffle path and a small shaded box to represent the central space that had been left exposed in the original action.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S13</id><text>After finishing the rough diagram, coach Harven Soll turned the whiteboard toward the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and asked the four on-court demonstrators whether the sketched distances matched how the situation had felt in the game, prompting a brief discussion about how far the second defender should have tucked inside.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S14</id><text>In the next clip that coach Harven Soll chose from the Varlen Crest Training Hall recording, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had to drop out of a high press, and coach Harven Soll replayed the five-second sequence three times to emphasize the moment when the \u201creset block\u201d instruction should be called by the back line.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S15</id><text>With the volume turned up, the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players could hear that no one actually shouted \u201creset block\u201d until after Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had already switched the ball to the far side, and coach Harven Soll paused on that frame to ask which defender should take responsibility for giving the early command.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S16</id><text>Coach Harven Soll tapped the projected image where the two deepest Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were visible and suggested that the left-sided defender or, failing that, goalkeeper Riven Hall needed to be the designated voice in such moments so that the whole unit could drop in time.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S17</id><text>After the initial video work on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll divided Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into two groups of five players and asked each group to rehearse a slow-motion \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d walk-through from the halfway line toward a corner without a ball while coach Harven Soll counted their steps aloud.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S18</id><text>The remaining two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players, including goalkeeper Riven Hall, initially observed from just outside the touchline before rotating into the patterns on the second and third repetitions so that every player practiced both the first and second defender roles.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S19</id><text>As each group shuffled from the halfway line toward the wall, coach Harven Soll counted \u201cone\u201d through \u201ceight\u201d in a firm voice, stopping the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pairs if they had not reached the imagined trap line by the sixth step and nudging them a little closer together with his hands.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S20</id><text>During a later block of the 2025-08-10 session, coach Harven Soll placed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall in front of one goal and arranged cones to represent Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attackers so that Riven Hall could practice goal throws aimed at spaces that a coordinated \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d press would be likely to leave open.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S21</id><text>The cones in front of goalkeeper Riven Hall were set out in two staggered lines in red and yellow, mirroring the typical positions of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17\u2019s pivot and wide players, with a clear channel left to the weak side that coach Harven Soll identified as the preferred target area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S22</id><text>In sets of a dozen repetitions, coach Harven Soll called out cues such as \u201cweak side\u201d or \u201cearly bounce,\u201d timing how quickly goalkeeper Riven Hall could collect an imaginary back-pass and deliver a firm, accurate throw into the designated corridor behind the simulated press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S23</id><text>To conclude the on-court segment on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll instructed every Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 player to select one key phrase from Pressing in Pairs, such as \u201clock line\u201d or \u201creset block,\u201d and to call out that phrase each time the player stepped into a pressing action during a final five-minute shadow pressing sequence.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S24</id><text>Some Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players chose the more descriptive cues that coach Harven Soll had written on the whiteboard earlier, shouting words like \u201cbody half-open\u201d or \u201cprotect middle\u201d as they moved, so that the court was filled with overlapping calls every time a pair slid into position.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S25</id><text>During the last minute of the shadow pressing sequence, the synchronized movements and sharp verbal cues from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players echoed off the high ceiling, drawing a curious glance from a school caretaker wheeling a trolley past the open doorway.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S26</id><text>After the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players left the indoor court on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll remained at Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to re-watch two Varlen Crest Training Hall clips on the laptop, adding detailed notes in his planning notebook that coach Harven Soll intended to share with Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 coach Deren Kavos ahead of the late-August joint review at Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S27</id><text>In his planning notebook, coach Harven Soll wrote down precise timestamps and short headings such as \u201c14:32 \u2013 late second cover, middle open\u201d and \u201c21:05 \u2013 Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 escape via pivot rotation,\u201d underlining a few questions he wanted to ask coach Deren Kavos about Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17\u2019s build-out decisions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S28</id><text>Coach Harven Soll finally closed the laptop and switched off the portable projector shortly before 20:00, locking the equipment cupboard at Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and slipping the annotated notebook into his bag so that it would be ready for the upcoming joint session at Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-08-22</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N8-S0</id><text>On 2025-08-22, coach Harven Soll began an after-school training session for Meadowlane

    "SELECTION_EXPLANATION": "\nN1-S22 uniquely characterizes Harven Soll as the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach who marked drills from the \"Pressing in Pairs\" article and integrated them into his July pre-season schedule. N9-S27, from a later event, shows the same coach posting a summary message in the Meadowlane U17 Futsal Chat group stating that Jasmin Korrel would start in goal and that Riven Hall would follow a gradual return plan before resuming full goalkeeping.\n\nTogether, these sentences enable a multi-hop question where the solver must:\n1) Identify Harven Soll from his specific use of \"Pressing in Pairs\" drills (N1-S22), and then\n2) Use that identification to find the name of the messaging group or the content of his later announcement (N9-S27).\n\nThis information is not recoverable from the knowledge base or from either sentence alone, so both sentences are needed with Harven Soll as the bridge entity.\n",
