Training Hall shortly after 17:30 for the rescheduled early-evening rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S1</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 stepped off a school minibus still in their green-and-white warm-up tops while most Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players filtered in from nearby streets, with a receptionist at Varlen Crest Training Hall directing both squads toward the main court changing rooms.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S2</id><text>As the players unpacked boots and shin pads, a low hum from the hall\u2019s ventilation system and the squeak of another group finishing a prior booking set the backdrop for informal greetings and brief reminders from staff that this fixture replaced the abandoned match at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S3</id><text>The match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 kicked off at approximately 18:05 on the main court of Varlen Crest Training Hall under the officiating of referee Javren Mesk.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S4</id><text>Referee Javren Mesk gathered both captains at the center circle before kick-off to confirm two 20-minute halves with a running clock and to stress quick restarts and respectful communication during what he described as \u201ca high-energy, but friendly, rematch.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S5</id><text>Roughly 40 to 50 spectators, including parents, siblings, and a few teammates from younger age groups, took seats along the sideline bleachers as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 in dark blue and Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in white and green lined up for the ceremonial handshakes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S6</id><text>In the 11th minute at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when winger Narel Vossin finished a fast counterattack with a low right-footed shot.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S7</id><text>The move began when a loose square pass from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near halfway was picked off and quickly shifted into a two-on-one break down the right, allowing Narel Vossin to cut inside onto his stronger foot before driving the ball across goalkeeper Riven Hall into the far corner.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S8</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 bench sprang to its feet as the electronic scoreboard flipped to 1\u20130, while two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defenders exchanged a brief glance and clapped their hands, urging teammates to tighten their next pressing sequence.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S9</id><text>Late in the first half at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 equalized to 1\u20131 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when wide player Talen Priev intercepted a pass created by a \u201cstep and cover\u201d press and scored from just inside the penalty area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S10</id><text>The equalizer arrived in the 18th minute when Talen Priev jumped a lateral pass near the left touchline, took one steadying touch inward, and snapped a low right-footed shot just inside the near post before the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could fully set his feet.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S11</id><text>As the ball hit the net, several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players shouted \u201clock line\u201d in unison, and coach Harven Soll quickly pointed to the pressing pair involved in the turnover, giving them a thumbs-up from the technical area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S12</id><text>Midway through the second half at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 went 2\u20131 ahead of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 midfielder Kelan Muvir converted a rebound from close range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S13</id><text>The decisive goal followed a firmly struck mid-range effort that the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could only parry into the middle of the area, where late-arriving midfielder Kelan Muvir reacted quickest to side-foot the loose ball in from around three meters out.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S14</id><text>Kelan Muvir wheeled away toward the corner with both arms raised before being surrounded by teammates, while referee Javren Mesk calmly signaled for the restart as the scoreboard ticked past the 10-minute mark of the second half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S15</id><text>Throughout both halves at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 consistently used the shared verbal cues \u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d to organize pressing actions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S16</id><text>The calls were loud enough that spectators could often hear entire pressing sequences being choreographed in real time, with the two coaches occasionally reinforcing a cue from the sidelines when a player hesitated between jumping to the ball or tucking in.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S17</id><text>On more than one occasion both teams shouted the same word at once during a contested build-up, drawing a brief ripple of amusement from the benches before attention snapped back to the ball.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S18</id><text>During the rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin operated a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a midcourt tripod to record the full match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S19</id><text>Selko Marin positioned the tripod on the first row of the central bleacher section near halfway, adjusted the zoom to capture both penalty areas, and checked that the red recording light stayed on as the match moved into its opening exchanges.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S20</id><text>During short stoppages, Selko Marin quietly noted goal times and a few key pressing situations on a folded sheet of paper so that coaches could later jump directly to those segments in the recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S21</id><text>After the final whistle confirming the 2\u20131 win for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 over Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, coach Harven Soll gathered Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near one goal at Varlen Crest Training Hall to praise the composure shown after falling behind.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S22</id><text>Standing just inside the penalty area, coach Harven Soll told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that \u201cwe stayed with our plan instead of chasing the game,\u201d highlighting how the equalizer and winner had both come from moments that began with disciplined pressing rather than rushed individual runs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S23</id><text>Several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players knelt to loosen their boots and stretch calves as they listened, sweat still dripping onto the wooden floor while they exchanged quick pats on the back and quiet congratulations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S24</id><text>In a separate post-match huddle at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos told Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 that Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had improved its pressing coordination against Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but needed sharper decision-making in possession.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S25</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos pointed to a late sequence where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 forced Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into a corner but then gave the ball away with a hurried diagonal pass, using it as an example of winning the press but not valuing the next touch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S26</id><text>A few Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players asked short questions about when to recycle through the goalkeeper or pivot under pressure, and coach Deren Kavos replied that these moments would be the main focus of the next week\u2019s training blocks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed to use the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder recording for a shorter follow-up joint video-review session later in August.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S28</id><text>Leaning over the edge of the court with their notebooks and phones out, the two coaches tentatively penciled in a midweek 45-minute slot before the start of the school league, agreeing that they would limit the session to a handful of key clips on pressing and build-out choices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S29</id><text>Selko Marin confirmed to both coaches that the full match file would be backed up onto an external drive that evening and exported into a shareable format so each staff could review segments on their own ahead of the joint meeting.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>",

feature page, where Neris Dalvo cited limited staff capacity and a preference for issuing broader coaching guidelines rather than detailed profiles of single teams.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S26</id><text>In the same comment, development coordinator Neris Dalvo nevertheless thanked Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 for setting \u201ca positive standard for preparation and sportsmanship\u201d and expressed support for independent publications that highlighted constructive youth coaching practices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S27</id><text>Despite the absence of dedicated case-study materials from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, local coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone and

players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S29</id><text>Some coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone scanned or photographed selected layouts from the feature series and shared them within small staff

Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S4</id><text>The equipment layout prepared by head coach Marlen Tiravo and fitness coach Kelran Dov on 2025-07-03 included a neat row of twelve white-and-blue size-4 futsal balls, two collapsible 2-by-3-meter portable goals, two flat agility ladders, and eight low yellow mini-hurdles positioned just inside the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S5</id><text>Fitness coach Kelran Dov, who had formally joined the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 staff at the start of July after previously assisting

court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S6</id><text>The futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03 had been purchased earlier in the

costs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S9</id><text>At the beginning of the 2025-07-03 session, the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 completed a gentle dynamic warm-up of jogging, joint-mobility work, and short accelerations under the supervision of head coach Marlen Tiravo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S10</id><text>The initial warm-up block for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03 lasted roughly 12 minutes and took place in two staggered lines running the length of the court, with exercises such as hip-openers, arm swings, and side shuffles interspersed between light jogs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S11</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo walked slowly along the sideline during the warm-up on 2025-07-03, occasionally stopping a player to adjust posture or stride length and reminding the group that the day\u2019s focus was on \u201cwaking the body up, not testing limits.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S12</id><text>Following the warm-up on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo organized Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 into small groups for individual ball-control stations that emphasized toe-touches, rolls, and turns using the new futsal balls supplied by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S13</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo divided the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players into three groups spread across half the court, rotating them every three minutes between stations that focused on fast toe-taps, sole rolls over five-meter lanes, and tight 180-degree turns around cones.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S14</id><text>During the ball-control segment on 2025-07-03, captain Mikel Ardan and flank player Sera Noll were asked by head coach Marlen Tiravo to demonstrate a sequence of inside-outside touches at one station before the rest of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 repeated the pattern at a slower tempo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S15</id><text>During the middle phase of the 2025-07-03 practice, fitness coach Kelran Dov led Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 through low-intensity agility patterns over the new ladders and mini-hurdles to reintroduce movement mechanics without imposing heavy physical load.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S16</id><text>The agility phase run by fitness coach Kelran Dov on 2025-07-03 featured simple in-in-out foot patterns through the ladders, lateral shuffles, and single-step hops over the mini-hurdles, with each repetition kept to 10\u201312 seconds followed by at least 30 seconds of rest.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S17</id><text>Fitness coach Kelran Dov carried a clipboard during the agility work for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17, jotting brief notes on knee alignment and upper-body control while offering verbal cues such as \u201csoft landings\u201d and \u201ceyes forward\u201d after each short set.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S18</id><text>In the final third of the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo set up the portable goals so that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 could perform relaxed finishing exercises with minimal defensive pressure and an emphasis on clean technique.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S19</id><text>For the finishing drills on 2025-07-03, the two portable goals were placed about nine meters from the end lines on opposite sides of the court, and Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players worked in pairs combining a wall pass and a controlled first touch before shooting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo encouraged the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players to alternate between dominant and weaker feet during the finishing segment and frequently stopped sequences to praise composed body shape or a well-placed low shot into the corners.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S21</id><text>At a brief pause before the last exercise block on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo told the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 that pressing drills and transition games would be deliberately postponed until the following week so that the team could first adjust to the new equipment.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S22</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the squad gathered around, head coach Marlen Tiravo explained that he wanted Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to \u201clearn exactly how these balls move on the floor before we ask you to sprint and press again,\u201d prompting several players to nod in agreement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S23</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also reminded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the pause that the concepts from the recent \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d article would still be part of the upcoming training cycle, but that 2025-07-03 was intended as a technical reset rather than an intense tactical session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S24</id><text>Toward the end of the 2025-07-03 training, goalkeeper Ren Talvek completed a short series of catching and distribution routines with the new futsal balls under the guidance of head coach Marlen Tiravo to assess the bounce and grip for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S25</id><text>Goalkeeper Ren Talvek\u2019s short block of work on 2025-07-03 included sets of low driven shots along the floor, high looping balls dropped from head coach Marlen Tiravo\u2019s hands, and side-arm throws toward marked zones near the touchline to test both handling and passing range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S26</id><text>After one sequence in which a shot skimmed off his gloves, goalkeeper Ren Talvek commented to head coach Marlen Tiravo that the new futsal balls felt \u201ca touch livelier off the surface\u201d than the previous batch, and the pair briefly discussed adjusting his stance for low saves.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S27</id><text>After the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo sent a brief email from the office of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy to development coordinator Neris Dalvo at Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council to report that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 had begun using the funded equipment and to thank Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council for the support.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S28</id><text>The email from head coach Marlen Tiravo to development coordinator Neris Dalvo was sent shortly after 17:15 on 2025-07-03 under the subject line \u201cEquipment grant update \u2013 Grendale U17\u201d and included two attached photographs of the new futsal balls and agility layout on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy indoor court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S29</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also copied the academy director on the 2025-07-03 message to Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, noting in one paragraph that the lighter session had helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 return from a short post-championship break without overloading the players.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-12</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N3-S0</id><text>On 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 hosted Varlen Crest Futsal Club

Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 student volunteer beside the court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S2</id><text>Around 35 spectators, mainly classmates, a few parents, and two teachers from the Meadowlane Quarter of Selvarin City, watched from the single row of retractable bleachers that runs along one touchline of the indoor court of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S3</id><text>Before the warm-up on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll gathered the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a short meeting to explain that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 would apply ideas from the article Pressing in Pairs by Lina Veress during the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S4</id><text>The pre-match meeting for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 took place in a narrow changing room beside the indoor court, where coach Harven Soll held up a printed copy of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly opened to the Pressing in Pairs diagrams and pointed out the roles of the first and second defender to the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll emphasized to Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that the goal of the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 was to communicate clearly and stay compact in the press, telling the squad that \u201cthe result matters less today than whether we move together in twos.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S6</id><text>During the pre-match warm-up on 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 ran their first on-court version of a paired pressing shadow drill adapted from Pressing in Pairs under the direct supervision of coach Harven Soll.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S7</id><text>In the paired pressing shadow drill, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players worked in twos along the halfway line, sliding sideways in unison to close imaginary passing lanes while coach Harven Soll shouted cues such as \u201cstep and cover\u201d and \u201cshow outside\u201d from just inside the center circle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S8</id><text>The overall warm-up for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 lasted about 18 minutes and combined the new shadow pressing movements with a brief four-versus-one rondo and a short shooting sequence before Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began its own preparations on the opposite half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S9</id><text>In the opening half of the 2025-07-12 friendly, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 kept the score 0\u20130 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 repeatedly used two-player presses to force the ball toward the sidelines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S10</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 set up in a 2\u20132 defensive shape for most of the first half and repeatedly angled pressure toward the left sideline, funneling Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into rushed passes that rolled harmlessly over the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S11</id><text>Although the score remained 0\u20130 before halftime, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 managed three shots on target compared with one clear chance for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, whose close-range effort was beaten away at the near post by the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S12</id><text>Early in the second half on 2025-07-12, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger finished a fast counterattack from the right side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S13</id><text>The opening goal for Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived roughly three minutes after the restart when a misplaced square pass by a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender near the attacking third was intercepted and quickly relayed into a three-pass counter down the right flank.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S14</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger cut inside toward the edge of the area and drove a firm low shot across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall into the far corner, putting Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 ahead 1\u20130.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S15</id><text>Midway through the second half on 2025-07-12, wide player Talen Priev equalized for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to make the score 1\u20131 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 with a low left-footed shot after intercepting a pass near halfway.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S16</id><text>The goal by wide player Talen Priev came around the ninth minute of the second half when Talen Priev stepped into a lateral pass near the center circle as Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sprung a coordinated press from the left side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S17</id><text>After carrying the ball roughly ten meters under pressure from a retreating Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender, Talen Priev opened his body and slid a left-footed finish inside the near post, drawing loud applause from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 supporters on the bleachers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S18</id><text>Throughout the second half on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll noted from the bench that the back line of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 shifted laterally and covered central space more consistently when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 activated paired presses inspired by Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S19</id><text>From his seat on the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 bench, coach Harven Soll periodically scribbled arrows and short comments on a clipboard, marking how the two central defenders tucked in behind the ball whenever Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pushed a first presser toward the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S20</id><text>Several times as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 tried to build through the middle, coach Harven Soll pointed toward the top of the penalty area and shouted reminders such as \u201cprotect the middle\u201d and \u201cclose the gap,\u201d prompting the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 back line to narrow their spacing compared with earlier in the season.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S21</id><text>After the final whistle of the 1\u20131 draw on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll told the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a brief huddle that the Pressing in Pairs-oriented work had improved the defensive shape of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 still needed to react faster to long diagonal passes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S22</id><text>The post-match huddle for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 formed near the center circle, with the players standing in a tight semicircle around coach Harven Soll, sweat-soaked bibs pulled over their school jerseys as they listened quietly to the feedback.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S23</id><text>Coach Harven Soll singled out one late Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attack that had exposed the far-post area, telling Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that upcoming sessions would focus on getting the weak-side defender to drop earlier whenever the opponent shaped to play a diagonal switch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S24</id><text>Following the post-match team talk on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll and visiting coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed at courtside that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 would arrange a second friendly later in July to further test the new pressing structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S25</id><text>While players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 shook hands and gathered scattered balls, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos stood near the halfway line comparing open dates in the last two weeks of July in their pocket notebooks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S26</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos remarked to coach Harven Soll that the adjusted pressing of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had forced Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into more long passes than usual, and both coaches discussed the possibility of recording short video clips of the next friendly for a joint post-game review.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S27</id><text>Later in the evening of 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll updated the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to schedule Pressing in Pairs-based defensive blocks twice a week in the remaining July sessions for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 before the school league begins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S28</id><text>At a kitchen table in the Meadowlane Quarter that evening, coach Harven Soll spread out the Meadowlane School

July.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S29</id><text>In the margin of the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll wrote a reminder to pair the defensive blocks with short transition games focusing on reacting to diagonal passes and covering the back post as preparation for the upcoming school league fixtures.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-24</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N4-S0</id><text>On the afternoon of 2025-07-24, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived at Northline Community Sports Hall in Selvarin City for a scheduled full-length pre-season futsal rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S1</id><text>Both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 reached Northline Community Sports Hall shortly after 15:30 by a mix of school minibus and parent cars, aiming for a 16:00 kick-off within a 90-minute booking window.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S2</id><text>Northline Community Sports Hall offered a single full-size futsal court marked on light grey synthetic flooring under a high arched roof, with a small two-row bleacher section along one touchline where a handful of early-arriving parents took seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S3</id><text>Shortly after Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began changing at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos noticed a steady leak in the roof dripping onto one end of the futsal court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S4</id><text>The leak at Northline Community Sports Hall was first noticed when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 substitute heard drops hitting the floor near the far goalmouth and called coach Deren Kavos over while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were still pulling on their socks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S5</id><text>Within a few minutes, a palm-sized wet patch had formed just inside the penalty area line at one end of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, with water steadily dripping from a seam in the metal roof despite the hall attendant placing a plastic bucket nearby.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S6</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked the playing area at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed that the wet patch and spreading moisture made a standard forty-minute futsal match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 unsafe.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S7</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked slowly from sideline to sideline at Northline Community Sports Hall, testing the surface with the soles of their trainers and noting that the damp section already extended roughly four meters into the playing area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S8</id><text>After briefly consulting the hall attendant at Northline Community Sports Hall about the likelihood of the leak stopping and hearing that it had been a recurring issue during recent rain showers, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos concluded that any full-speed sprints toward that goal would pose too much risk of slipping.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos decided to mark off the damp third of the floor at Northline Community Sports Hall with cones and to shorten the available playing space so that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could still complete a controlled training session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S10</id><text>Using a set of bright orange flat cones brought by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and yellow dome cones from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos created a clear no-entry zone that effectively shortened the court to about two-thirds of its normal length at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S11</id><text>While coach Harven Soll quickly crossed out his planned full-match structure in his notebook and jotted down revised timings for drill blocks, coach Deren Kavos explained to a small cluster of puzzled players that the session at Northline Community Sports Hall would emphasize decision-making and pressing rather than match intensity.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S12</id><text>Before starting any ball work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 carried out a joint warm-up on the dry half of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, focusing on light mobility exercises and simple two-player passing patterns.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S13</id><text>The joint warm-up at Northline Community Sports Hall lasted around 15 minutes and began with slow jogging, hip-openers, ankle rolls, and arm swings led by coach Harven Soll before coach Deren Kavos introduced short side shuffles and gentle backward skips.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S14</id><text>After the mobility work at Northline Community Sports Hall, the two coaches paired players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 together in five-meter channels along the sideline to exchange firm right-foot and left-foot passes while calling each other\u2019s names to encourage communication.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S15</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos set up a camera identified as a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a fixed tripod at midcourt in Northline Community Sports Hall to record joint paired-pressing drills by Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 based on concepts from the article Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S16</id><text>The Ravelin VX-2 camcorder belonged to Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and had been brought to Northline Community Sports Hall in a padded black case, with coach Deren Kavos checking that the battery indicator was full and that a 32-gigabyte memory card provided enough space for the afternoon\u2019s work.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S17</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos positioned the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder at midcourt atop the second row of the bleachers at Northline Community Sports Hall, angling the lens slightly downward so the frame captured the entire dry half and the touchline along which the presses would be directed.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S18</id><text>In the main training block, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 mixed players into two balanced squads and ran repeated short sequences in which the first and second defender executed Pressing in Pairs cues toward the sideline while the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder captured every repetition.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S19</id><text>The mixed squads at Northline Community Sports Hall were balanced so that each included two regular defenders, two attackers, and a goalkeeper from across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, with colored bibs used to distinguish the sides regardless of school kit.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S20</id><text>During the main training block at Northline Community Sports Hall, sequences typically lasted 6 to 8 seconds as two defenders snapped into a coordinated press against three circulating attackers, after which coach Harven Soll or coach Deren Kavos would briefly freeze the play to reposition body angles or remind players of the \u201cstep and cover\u201d cue before restarting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S21</id><text>To conclude the on-court work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 played a single twelve-minute mixed-squad training game on the reduced court at Northline Community Sports Hall with informal rules that rewarded successful paired presses instead of keeping a formal score.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S22</id><text>For the twelve-minute mixed-squad training game at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches dubbed the teams \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cGreen\u201d based on bib color and instructed the players that each successful paired press in the attacking half earning a clear turnover would count as one point, even though no official scoreboard was used.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S23</id><text>To reduce physical strain on the shortened court at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches agreed on roll-on substitutions and relaxed restart rules, allowing quick kick-ins from the sidelines so that the flow of play remained centered on creating and responding to pressing situations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S24</id><text>After the session, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos reviewed a brief segment of the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder footage on the camera screen at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed to share the full recording between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 for a joint video-review meeting the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S25</id><text>After the final whistle at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos gathered near the tripod and replayed a 30-second clip in which a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arrived late as the second presser, using the pause button on the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to highlight spacing issues to the small group of nearby players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S26</id><text>Coach Harven Soll offered to copy the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder file from Northline Community Sports Hall onto a portable USB drive and to upload a version to a shared online folder so that both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could access the footage during the joint review planned for the middle of the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S27</id><text>Before leaving Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Deren Kavos and coach Harven Soll confirmed a new date in early August for a full rematch between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, explaining the revised plan to the assembled players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S28</id><text>In confirming the rearranged match at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos suggested an early-evening weekday slot in the first full week of August so that parents could attend after work, and coach Harven Soll checked his paper planner before nodding and noting the time beside the new fixture entry.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S29</id><text>As the players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered around at Northline Community Sports Hall to hear the explanation, several expressed disappointment at missing out on a full match that day, but both coaches stressed that the safer surface and additional video preparation would help make the August rematch more useful for everyone.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-29</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N5-S0</id><text>On the evening of 2025-07-29, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered in a meeting room at Varlen Crest Training Hall for a joint video-review session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S1</id><text>The joint video-review session began shortly after 18:30, with around twenty players and the two head coaches filing into a rectangular room furnished with three rows of plastic chairs facing a pull-down projection screen.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S2</id><text>The windows of the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room were tilted open to the warm summer air, and a faint echo of ball sounds from the main court nearby could be heard as the players settled into mixed groups rather than sitting strictly by team.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S3</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 connected the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to a ceiling-mounted Trinovar Castline P7 projector in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to display the 2025-07-24 training footage.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S4</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 used a short black HDMI cable to link the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to the Trinovar Castline P7 projector input panel, then dimmed the room lights so the footage appeared as a clear, wall-filling image near the far end of the meeting room.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S5</id><text>On the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder menu, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had already bookmarked four key clips by timestamp, allowing quick jumps between pressing sequences and build-up examples from the 2025-07-24 session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S6</id><text>Before starting the playback, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players that the main aim of the meeting was to refine shared \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d cues from both defensive and build-up perspectives.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S7</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 added that the evening was \u201cnot about blaming anyone on the screen, but about learning what our next decisions should look like,\u201d prompting several players from both squads to nod and shift forward in their seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S8</id><text>A few Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players quietly opened small spiral notebooks on their laps as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 spoke, ready to jot down any cues or passing patterns that might be useful in the August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to watch an early clip where Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 applied a sideline press and to focus on the body angles of the second defender.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S10</id><text>The selected clip from the 2025-07-24 recording showed a Blue-bibbed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arriving slightly square to the touchline on the right side, and coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 replayed the five-second action twice so everyone could see how that angle affected the trap.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S11</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pointed toward the projected image with the cap of his marker and asked the mixed group whether the second defender\u2019s front foot should be pointing more toward the ball or more toward the center, inviting short, one-word answers from the front row.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S12</id><text>During a paused frame of the same sequence, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 used a whiteboard in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to sketch the ideal positions for the first and second defender in the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S13</id><text>On the whiteboard, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 drew a simplified half-court diagram with small crosses for defenders, circles for attackers, and a bold arrow showing the first defender\u2019s pressing run toward the sideline while the second defender staggered half a step behind and slightly inside.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S14</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 wrote \u201c1.5 steps gap\u201d and \u201cbody half-open\u201d beside the second defender\u2019s symbol, explaining that this spacing allowed quick cover if the opponent cut inside or played a bounce pass back toward the middle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S15</id><text>In a later segment of the video, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 highlighted a passage where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 struggled to build out from the back against the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 press and invited Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to suggest alternative passing options.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S16</id><text>The paused scene showed the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper holding the ball with both flank options tightly marked and a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 forward closing in, and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 asked whether a quick diagonal pass to the pivot between the lines or a wall pass off the near defender would have been safer.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S17</id><text>One Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender raised a hand and suggested that a pre-agreed rotation, with the far-side defender stepping into the middle as a third option, could have created a clearer passing lane against the two-player press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S18</id><text>The goalkeepers from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 sat together in the front row while coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 replayed short goal-throw sequences to discuss how the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d cues influenced distribution choices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S19</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall leaned forward with elbows on his knees, occasionally jotting single words such as \u201cquick start\u201d and \u201clook weak side\u201d on a small notepad as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 paused and rewound individual throws.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S20</id><text>On one freeze-frame, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 traced an imaginary passing line across the bottom of the projected image, explaining to both goalkeepers how an early release toward the side opposite the incoming paired press could bypass two defenders before they locked the line.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S21</id><text>Midway through the session, a brief break at the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room allowed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to take water and snacks set out on a side table by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S22</id><text>The refreshments arranged by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin consisted of large plastic jugs of water, paper cups, sliced oranges, and a tray of small cheese-and-vegetable sandwiches laid out beside a stack of napkins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S23</id><text>During the five-minute pause, small mixed groups of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players chatted quietly about the toughest pressing drills from 2025-07-24 and compared who would likely start in the upcoming August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S24</id><text>In the final discussion block, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 jointly wrote three agreed verbal cues\u2014\u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d\u2014on the Varlen Crest Training Hall whiteboard as shared terminology for the upcoming August rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S25</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 printed the three phrases in large capital letters while coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 added a short explanation next to each, such as \u201clock line = no pass between us and the ball\u201d to make the meaning clear for both squads.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S26</id><text>Several players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 quickly took photos of the whiteboard on their phones after being encouraged by coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 to use the cues as standard language in their next team training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 handed the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players photocopied pages from the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly article \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress, marked with notes to apply specific drills in the next two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S28</id><text>On the photocopied pages, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had highlighted several paragraphs in yellow and circled two small-field exercises, writing timings like \u201cTue \u2013 15 min: 3v3 trap in corner\u201d in the margins to signal how they would be inserted into the upcoming schedule.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S29</id><text>As the meeting wrapped up, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players folded the marked handouts into their backpacks, with a few quietly remarking to each other that it felt different seeing the same diagrams from the magazine now directly linked to their own video clips on the screen.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-08-06</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N6-S0</id><text>On 2025-08-06, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived at Varlen Crest Training Hall shortly after 17:30 for the rescheduled early-evening rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S1</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 stepped off a school minibus still in their green-and-white warm-up tops while most Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players filtered in from nearby streets, with a receptionist at Varlen Crest Training Hall directing both squads toward the main court changing rooms.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S2</id><text>As the players unpacked boots and shin pads, a low hum from the hall\u2019s ventilation system and the squeak of another group finishing a prior booking set the backdrop for informal greetings and brief reminders from staff that this fixture replaced the abandoned match at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S3</id><text>The match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 kicked off at approximately 18:05 on the main court of Varlen Crest Training Hall under the officiating of referee Javren Mesk.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S4</id><text>Referee Javren Mesk gathered both captains at the center circle before kick-off to confirm two 20-minute halves with a running clock and to stress quick restarts and respectful communication during what he described as \u201ca high-energy, but friendly, rematch.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S5</id><text>Roughly 40 to 50 spectators, including parents, siblings, and a few teammates from younger age groups, took seats along the sideline bleachers as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 in dark blue and Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in white and green lined up for the ceremonial handshakes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S6</id><text>In the 11th minute at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when winger Narel Vossin finished a fast counterattack with a low right-footed shot.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S7</id><text>The move began when a loose square pass from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near halfway was picked off and quickly shifted into a two-on-one break down the right, allowing Narel Vossin to cut inside onto his stronger foot before driving the ball across goalkeeper Riven Hall into the far corner.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S8</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 bench sprang to its feet as the electronic scoreboard flipped to 1\u20130, while two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defenders exchanged a brief glance and clapped their hands, urging teammates to tighten their next pressing sequence.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S9</id><text>Late in the first half at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 equalized to 1\u20131 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when wide player Talen Priev intercepted a pass created by a \u201cstep and cover\u201d press and scored from just inside the penalty area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S10</id><text>The equalizer arrived in the 18th minute when Talen Priev jumped a lateral pass near the left touchline, took one steadying touch inward, and snapped a low right-footed shot just inside the near post before the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could fully set his feet.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S11</id><text>As the ball hit the net, several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players shouted \u201clock line\u201d in unison, and coach Harven Soll quickly pointed to the pressing pair involved in the turnover, giving them a thumbs-up from the technical area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S12</id><text>Midway through the second half at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 went 2\u20131 ahead of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 midfielder Kelan Muvir converted a rebound from close range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S13</id><text>The decisive goal followed a firmly struck mid-range effort that the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could only parry into the middle of the area, where late-arriving midfielder Kelan Muvir reacted quickest to side-foot the loose ball in from around three meters out.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S14</id><text>Kelan Muvir wheeled away toward the corner with both arms raised before being surrounded by teammates, while referee Javren Mesk calmly signaled for the restart as the scoreboard ticked past the 10-minute mark of the second half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S15</id><text>Throughout both halves at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 consistently used the shared verbal cues \u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d to organize pressing actions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S16</id><text>The calls were loud enough that spectators could often hear entire pressing sequences being choreographed in real time, with the two coaches occasionally reinforcing a cue from the sidelines when a player hesitated between jumping to the ball or tucking in.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S17</id><text>On more than one occasion both teams shouted the same word at once during a contested build-up, drawing a brief ripple of amusement from the benches before attention snapped back to the ball.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S18</id><text>During the rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin operated a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a midcourt tripod to record the full match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S19</id><text>Selko Marin positioned the tripod on the first row of the central bleacher section near halfway, adjusted the zoom to capture both penalty areas, and checked that the red recording light stayed on as the match moved into its opening exchanges.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S20</id><text>During short stoppages, Selko Marin quietly noted goal times and a few key pressing situations on a folded sheet of paper so that coaches could later jump directly to those segments in the recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S21</id><text>After the final whistle confirming the 2\u20131 win for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 over Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, coach Harven Soll gathered Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near one goal at Varlen Crest Training Hall to praise the composure shown after falling behind.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S22</id><text>Standing just inside the penalty area, coach Harven Soll told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that \u201cwe stayed with our plan instead of chasing the game,\u201d highlighting how the equalizer and winner had both come from moments that began with disciplined pressing rather than rushed individual runs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S23</id><text>Several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players knelt to loosen their boots and stretch calves as they listened, sweat still dripping onto the wooden floor while they exchanged quick pats on the back and quiet congratulations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S24</id><text>In a separate post-match huddle at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos told Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 that Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had improved its pressing coordination against Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but needed sharper decision-making in possession.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S25</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos pointed to a late sequence where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 forced Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into a corner but then gave the ball away with a hurried diagonal pass, using it as an example of winning the press but not valuing the next touch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S26</id><text>A few Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players asked short questions about when to recycle through the goalkeeper or pivot under pressure, and coach Deren Kavos replied that these moments would be the main focus of the next week\u2019s training blocks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed to use the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder recording for a shorter follow-up joint video-review session later in August.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S28</id><text>Leaning over the edge of the court with their notebooks and phones out, the two coaches tentatively penciled in a midweek 45-minute slot before the start of the school league, agreeing that they would limit the session to a handful of key clips on pressing and build-out choices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S29</id><text>Selko Marin confirmed to both coaches that the full match file would be backed up onto an external drive that evening and exported into a shareable format so each staff could review segments on their own ahead of the joint meeting.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>",

Only N6-S3 gives the absolute start time; only N6-S10 gives the match-minute of the equalizer. No other sentence supplies either of these specifics.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask: \u201cHow long after kick-off did Talen Priev score his equalizer?\u201d while:\n  - Forcing use of N6-S3 to get the kick-off time.\n  - Forcing use of N6-S10 to get the \u201c18th minute\u201d information.\n- The question will explicitly state the assumption that \u201c18th minute\u201d is interpreted in the usual way and that, for calculation, the equalizer is taken as occurring at the start of that minute. This keeps the problem well-posed and makes the temporal reasoning necessary.\n- No explicit wall-clock time or minute numbers from the sentences will be mentioned in the question; the solver must extract them from both sentences.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Kick-off: 18:05 (from N6-S3, treating \u201capproximately\u201d as exact).\n- Equalizer: in the 18th minute (from N6-S10).\n- Under standard convention, 18th minute starts at 17:00 of match time.\n- Assume equalizer at start of 18th minute:\n  - Elapsed from kick-off = 17 minutes.\n  - Wall-clock equalizer time = 18:05 + 17 minutes = 18:22.\n- Required duration between kick-off and equalizer = 17 minutes.\n\n</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI need to verify and, if needed, correct the earlier question-answer pair so it fully complies with the instructions.\n\nKey constraints from the task:\n- The question must ask for a duration between two points in time.\n- It must require ALL selected sentences to answer.\n- No other sentence can substitute any of the selected sentences.\n- We may add extra sentences if they introduce unique necessary information.\n- The question must not itself include the crucial temporal values (times, minutes, dates); they must be inferred from the sentences.\n- Avoid mixing time units in a way the instructions disallow (they specifically mention not mixing, e.g., minutes and days).\n\nOriginal selected sentences:\n- N6-S3: gives the kick-off time of the rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall.\n- N6-S10: gives the match-minute in which the equalizer was scored.\n\nIssue with the prior response:\n- The earlier question only asked: \u201cHow long after kick-off did Talen Priev score his equalizer?\u201d\n- That elapsed time (17 minutes) can be deduced from N6-S10 alone, using the convention of what \u201c18th minute\u201d means; it does not require N6-S3.\n- This violates the requirement that ALL selected sentences must be needed to answer the question.\n\nTherefore, I need to:\n- Redesign the question so that it depends on:\n  - The kick-off time from N6-S3.\n  - The equalizer\u2019s minute from N6-S10.\n- And also have a *second* absolute reference time, so we measure a duration between that reference and the equalizer.\n\nTo get that second reference time, I will add:\n\nAdditional sentence:\n- N5-S1: \u201cThe joint video-review session began shortly after 18:30, with around twenty players and the two head coaches filing into a rectangular room furnished with three rows of plastic chairs facing a pull-down projection screen.\u201d\n  - Event date block: 2025-07-29.\n  - Unique info: gives the wall-clock start time of a joint video-review session.\n\nEven though N5-S1 is on a different date (2025-07-29) than N6-S3/N6-S10 (2025-08-06), we are explicitly allowed to compare times across dates. The question will reference that this review session happened earlier and the match later.\n\nNow I must:\n- Turn the approximate times into exact values using assumptions explicitly mentioned in the question.\n- Calculate the wall-clock time of the equalizer.\n- Then compute the elapsed time between the start of the review session and the equalizer.\n\nStep-by-step time extraction and assumptions:\n\n1) N6-S3\nText: \u201cThe match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 kicked off at approximately 18:05 on the main court of Varlen Crest Training Hall under the officiating of referee Javren Mesk.\u201d\n\n- Event date:\n  - This is in the 2025-08-06 block, so the match is on 2025-08-06.\n- Time info:\n  - Kick-off at \u201capproximately 18:05\u201d.\n\nAssumptions:\n- For calculation, interpret \u201capproximately 18:05\u201d as exactly 18:05.\n- Kick-off corresponds to 0:00 on the match clock.\n\nAbsolute datetime:\n- T_kickoff = 2025-08-06 18:05.\n\n2) N6-S10\nText: \u201cThe equalizer arrived in the 18th minute when Talen Priev jumped a lateral pass near the left touchline, took one steadying touch inward, and snapped a low right-footed shot just inside the near post before the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could fully set his feet.\u201d\n\n- Event date:\n  - Same match on 2025-08-06.\n- Time info:\n  - Equalizer in the \u201c18th minute\u201d of play.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Standard football/futsal convention: the 18th minute covers elapsed time from 17:00 up to (but not including) 18:00 on the match clock.\n- To get a unique instant, assume the equalizer occurs exactly at the *start* of the 18th minute, i.e., at 17 minutes elapsed.\n\nDerived times:\n- Elapsed time from kick-off to equalizer: 17 minutes.\n- Wall-clock time of equalizer:\n  - T_equalizer = T_kickoff + 17 minutes\n  - = 2025-08-06 18:05 + 0:17\n  - = 2025-08-06 18:22.\n\n3) N5-S1 (additional)\nText: \u201cThe joint video-review session began shortly after 18:30, with around twenty players and the two head coaches filing into a rectangular room furnished with three rows of plastic chairs facing a pull-down projection screen.\u201d\n\n- Event date:\n  - This is in the 2025-07-29 block, so the review session is on 2025-07-29.\n- Time info:\n  - Review starts \u201cshortly after 18:30\u201d.\n\nAssumptions:\n- For calculation, interpret \u201cshortly after 18:30\u201d as exactly 18:30.\n\nAbsolute datetime:\n- T_review_start = 2025-07-29 18:30.\n\nNow define the two endpoints for the duration:\n- Start of interval: T_review_start = 2025-07-29 18:30.\n- End of interval: T_equalizer = 2025-08-06 18:22.\n\nCompute elapsed duration:\n\nMethod 1: via 8 days minus time difference\n\n1. From 2025-07-29 18:30 to 2025-08-06 18:30:\n   - 29\u219230 July: 1 day\n   - 30\u219231 July: +1 day (2 days)\n   - 31 July\u21921 August: +1 day (3 days)\n   - 1\u21922 August: +1 day (4 days)\n   - 2\u21923 August: +1 day (5 days)\n   - 3\u21924 August: +1 day (6 days)\n   - 4\u21925 August: +1 day (7 days)\n   - 5\u21926 August: +1 day (8 days)\n   - So: 8 days exactly from 2025-07-29 18:30 to 2025-08-06 18:30.\n\n2. Adjust from 18:30 to 18:22 on 2025-08-06:\n   - This is 8 minutes earlier than 18:30.\n   - So the total elapsed time:\n     - = 8 days \u2212 8 minutes\n     - = 7 days 23 hours 52 minutes.\n\nMethod 2: convert everything to minutes to ensure a single unit:\n\n- 1 day = 24 hours = 1440 minutes.\n- 8 days = 8 \u00d7 1440 = 11520 minutes.\n- Subtract 8 minutes \u2192 11520 \u2212 8 = 11512 minutes.\n\nSo the elapsed time between T_review_start and T_equalizer:\n- = 11512 minutes.\n\nUnit choice:\n- The instructions warn against mixing units like minutes and days, days and years, etc.\n- To keep it safe and unambiguous, I will provide the answer solely in minutes: 11512 minutes.\n\nCheck necessity of each sentence:\n\n- N5-S1:\n  - Needed to know the wall-clock start time of the review session.\n  - Without it, you cannot know T_review_start.\n\n- N6-S3:\n  - Needed for the wall-clock kick-off time.\n  - Without it, even if you know the equalizer was in the 18th minute, you cannot translate that match-minute into an absolute time.\n\n- N6-S10:\n  - Needed to know how far into the match (in minutes) the equalizer occurred.\n  - Without it, you cannot know T_equalizer relative to kick-off.\n\nNo other sentences in the outline provide these particular combinations of:\n- the video-review start time,\n- the rematch kick-off time,\n- and the minute of the equalizer.\n\nThus, all three are required, and none can be replaced by another sentence.\n\nNow, ensure question wording:\n- Does not explicitly mention the numerical times (\u201c18:05\u201d, \u201c18:30\u201d) or the \u201c18th minute\u201d directly.\n- Instead, it references them descriptively (\u201cthe kick-off time described for the rematch\u201d, \u201cthe minute of play in which the equalizer was scored\u201d, \u201cthe start time of the joint video-review session\u201d).\n- Explicitly states all assumptions about treating \u201capproximately\u201d and \u201cshortly after\u201d as exact times, and about the interpretation of the \u201c18th minute\u201d.\n\nFinal duration:\n- 11512 minutes.\n\n</scratchpad>",
