costs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S9</id><text>At the beginning of the 2025-07-03 session, the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 completed a gentle dynamic warm-up of jogging, joint-mobility work, and short accelerations under the supervision of head coach Marlen Tiravo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S10</id><text>The initial warm-up block for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03 lasted roughly 12 minutes and took place in two staggered lines running the length of the court, with exercises such as hip-openers, arm swings, and side shuffles interspersed between light jogs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S11</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo walked slowly along the sideline during the warm-up on 2025-07-03, occasionally stopping a player to adjust posture or stride length and reminding the group that the day\u2019s focus was on \u201cwaking the body up, not testing limits.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S12</id><text>Following the warm-up on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo organized Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 into small groups for individual ball-control stations that emphasized toe-touches, rolls, and turns using the new futsal balls supplied by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S13</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo divided the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players into three groups spread across half the court, rotating them every three minutes between stations that focused on fast toe-taps, sole rolls over five-meter lanes, and tight 180-degree turns around cones.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S14</id><text>During the ball-control segment on 2025-07-03, captain Mikel Ardan and flank player Sera Noll were asked by head coach Marlen Tiravo to demonstrate a sequence of inside-outside touches at one station before the rest of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 repeated the pattern at a slower tempo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S15</id><text>During the middle phase of the 2025-07-03 practice, fitness coach Kelran Dov led Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 through low-intensity agility patterns over the new ladders and mini-hurdles to reintroduce movement mechanics without imposing heavy physical load.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S16</id><text>The agility phase run by fitness coach Kelran Dov on 2025-07-03 featured simple in-in-out foot patterns through the ladders, lateral shuffles, and single-step hops over the mini-hurdles, with each repetition kept to 10\u201312 seconds followed by at least 30 seconds of rest.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S17</id><text>Fitness coach Kelran Dov carried a clipboard during the agility work for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17, jotting brief notes on knee alignment and upper-body control while offering verbal cues such as \u201csoft landings\u201d and \u201ceyes forward\u201d after each short set.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S18</id><text>In the final third of the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo set up the portable goals so that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 could perform relaxed finishing exercises with minimal defensive pressure and an emphasis on clean technique.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S19</id><text>For the finishing drills on 2025-07-03, the two portable goals were placed about nine meters from the end lines on opposite sides of the court, and Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players worked in pairs combining a wall pass and a controlled first touch before shooting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo encouraged the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players to alternate between dominant and weaker feet during the finishing segment and frequently stopped sequences to praise composed body shape or a well-placed low shot into the corners.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S21</id><text>At a brief pause before the last exercise block on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo told the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 that pressing drills and transition games would be deliberately postponed until the following week so that the team could first adjust to the new equipment.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S22</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the squad gathered around, head coach Marlen Tiravo explained that he wanted Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to \u201clearn exactly how these balls move on the floor before we ask you to sprint and press again,\u201d prompting several players to nod in agreement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S23</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also reminded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the pause that the concepts from the recent \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d article would still be part of the upcoming training cycle, but that 2025-07-03 was intended as a technical reset rather than an intense tactical session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S24</id><text>Toward the end of the 2025-07-03 training, goalkeeper Ren Talvek completed a short series of catching and distribution routines with the new futsal balls under the guidance of head coach Marlen Tiravo to assess the bounce and grip for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S25</id><text>Goalkeeper Ren Talvek\u2019s short block of work on 2025-07-03 included sets of low driven shots along the floor, high looping balls dropped from head coach Marlen Tiravo\u2019s hands, and side-arm throws toward marked zones near the touchline to test both handling and passing range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S26</id><text>After one sequence in which a shot skimmed off his gloves, goalkeeper Ren Talvek commented to head coach Marlen Tiravo that the new futsal balls felt \u201ca touch livelier off the surface\u201d than the previous batch, and the pair briefly discussed adjusting his stance for low saves.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S27</id><text>After the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo sent a brief email from the office of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy to development coordinator Neris Dalvo at Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council to report that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 had begun using the funded equipment and to thank Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council for the support.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S28</id><text>The email from head coach Marlen Tiravo to development coordinator Neris Dalvo was sent shortly after 17:15 on 2025-07-03 under the subject line \u201cEquipment grant update \u2013 Grendale U17\u201d and included two attached photographs of the new futsal balls and agility layout on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy indoor court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S29</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also copied the academy director on the 2025-07-03 message to Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, noting in one paragraph that the lighter session had helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 return from a short post-championship break without overloading the players.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>",

deadline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S2</id><text>Editor Ralen Ko specifically cited the composed courtside interview that Lina Veress had conducted with head coach Marlen Tiravo after the final as a key reason for assigning the feature, believing that Lina Veress could balance tactical detail with human-interest storytelling for a youth audience.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S3</id><text>On 2025-06-18, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granted Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly permission to reproduce selected statistics and photographs from the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship in the feature series authored by Lina Veress.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S4</id><text>The permission was confirmed in a two-page email agreement signed off by Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council chairperson Doran Helv, stipulating that all images be credit-lined to the council archive and used only in connection with non-elite youth futsal education.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S5</id><text>Along with the written approval, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council provided Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly with a folder of 24 high-resolution action photographs and the official match-statistics spreadsheets for all five fixtures played by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S6</id><text>In preparation for the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series, Lina Veress conducted extended interviews with head coach Marlen Tiravo of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 focusing on training structure, team culture, and the weeks leading up to the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S7</id><text>The interviews consisted of two evening video calls and one in-person conversation at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy office, each lasting around 70 to 90 minutes, with head coach Marlen Tiravo bringing along a binder of weekly training schedules from January to March 2025.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S8</id><text>During these discussions, head coach Marlen Tiravo described specific routines such as Monday small-sided pressing games and Thursday match-simulation blocks, and emphasized to Lina Veress how player-led feedback circles on Fridays had helped shape the squad\u2019s sense of collective responsibility.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S9</id><text>Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly staff used match footage from Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center to create tactical diagrams and sequence illustrations that visually supported the written analysis by Lina Veress of the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 performances.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S10</id><text>The magazine\u2019s two-person analysis team replayed key passages from the semifinal and final on a large screen in their editing room, manually logging pressing triggers, passing lanes, and player rotations that could be translated into simplified diagrams for young readers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S11</id><text>Graphic designer Hele Narm transformed these notes into four full-page diagrams and several smaller in-text sequences, using colored arrows and numbered frames to show how Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 shifted from a compact 2\u20132 block into coordinated counter-attacks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S12</id><text>On the morning of 2025-06-30, Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly released its mid-year print issue featuring a multi-part analytical series by Lina Veress on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 campaign at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S13</id><text>The issue, Volume 13 Number 2, had a print run of approximately 2,500 copies and was distributed to secondary schools, community sports halls, and neighborhood kiosks across Selvarin City and the Grendale Suburban Zone at a cover price of 8 selvars.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S14</id><text>The front cover of the mid-year issue featured a full-width photograph of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 captain Mikel Ardan lifting the championship trophy, with a headline banner reading \u201cHow Grendale Built a Champion Team.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S15</id><text>Within the 2025-06-30 issue of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly, an article titled \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress detailed a recurring defensive pattern used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship and translated it into step-by-step drills for youth coaches.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S16</id><text>The \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d piece filled four magazine pages and broke the concept into three progressive training blocks, each specifying recommended pitch dimensions, work-to-rest ratios, and suggested adaptations for under-13, under-15, and under-17 age groups.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S17</id><text>A highlighted sidebar within the article quoted head coach Marlen Tiravo explaining how a simple verbal cue of \u201cstep and cover\u201d helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players coordinate their movements when initiating the paired press in competitive matches.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S18</id><text>On the afternoon of 2025-06-30, head coach Marlen Tiravo held a classroom-style review session at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy training facility where Marlen Tiravo distributed copies of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series by Lina Veress to the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S19</id><text>The review session took place in a small upstairs meeting room overlooking the indoor training court, with around a dozen players seated at desks while head coach Marlen Tiravo used a whiteboard and a projector to walk through key diagrams from the magazine.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo asked each player of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to highlight at least one paragraph that reflected their own habits, leading to a brief discussion in which several players expressed surprise at seeing their off-the-ball work described in print.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S21</id><text>By the evening of 2025-06-30, several school futsal coaches in Selvarin City, including Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach Harven Soll, reported using the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly articles by Lina Veress as practical reference material for planning upcoming youth training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S22</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 marked specific drills from \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d with sticky notes in his planning notebook and penciled them into his July pre-season schedule as alternatives to his standard defensive warm-up routines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S23</id><text>Other coaches in Selvarin City mentioned in informal messages to editor Ralen Ko that they appreciated the clear field diagrams and ready-made session plans, which allowed them to adapt Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 concepts without having to design exercises from scratch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S24</id><text>In a brief comment published alongside the feature series on 2025-06-30, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council development coordinator Neris Dalvo stated that Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council did not plan to produce separate official school case-study booklets about the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 title run.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S25</id><text>The note from development coordinator Neris Dalvo appeared in a shaded \u201cCouncil Perspective\u201d box at the bottom of the first feature page, where Neris Dalvo cited limited staff capacity and a preference for issuing broader coaching guidelines rather than detailed profiles of single teams.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S26</id><text>In the same comment, development coordinator Neris Dalvo nevertheless thanked Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 for setting \u201ca positive standard for preparation and sportsmanship\u201d and expressed support for independent publications that highlighted constructive youth coaching practices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S27</id><text>Despite the absence of dedicated case-study materials from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, local coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone and broader Selvarin City began informally treating the series by Lina Veress in Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly as a de facto reference document for youth futsal training discussions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S28</id><text>During informal planning conversations and email exchanges on 2025-06-30, several coaches referred to specific pages of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly issue\u2014such as the transition-attack diagram on page 11\u2014as shorthand examples when debating how aggressively to press with teenage players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S29</id><text>Some coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone scanned or photographed selected layouts from the feature series and shared them within small staff groups, using the material as a common visual basis for adjusting their own session content rather than as any kind of official curriculum.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-03</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N2-S0</id><text>On 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo led a 90-minute low-pressure afternoon training session for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 at the indoor court of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S1</id><text>The 90-minute training window for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03 ran from 15:30 to 17:00, with the overhead lights switched on despite clear weather outside to keep the indoor court conditions consistent.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S2</id><text>A total of 11 players from the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 registered squad attended the 2025-07-03 session, with one player excused in advance due to a minor illness reported to head coach Marlen Tiravo earlier in the day.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S3</id><text>Before the start of the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo and newly appointed fitness coach Kelran Dov arranged the new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment along one side of the indoor court of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy for use by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S4</id><text>The equipment layout prepared by head coach Marlen Tiravo and fitness coach Kelran Dov on 2025-07-03 included a neat row of twelve white-and-blue size-4 futsal balls, two collapsible 2-by-3-meter portable goals, two flat agility ladders, and eight low yellow mini-hurdles positioned just inside the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S5</id><text>Fitness coach Kelran Dov, who had formally joined the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 staff at the start of July after previously assisting with younger age groups at the academy, took several minutes to check ball inflation with a handheld pressure gauge before the players stepped onto the court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S6</id><text>The futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03 had been purchased earlier in the week by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy with part of the development grant previously awarded by Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S7</id><text>According to staff at Grendale Youth Futsal Academy, the order for the new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment had been placed with a Selvarin City sports supplier on 2025-06-30 and delivered to the Grendale Suburban Zone facility on the afternoon of 2025-07-02.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S8</id><text>Around two-thirds of the 3,000-selvars development grant from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council was allocated to the equipment package used on 2025-07-03, with the remaining funds at Grendale Youth Futsal Academy earmarked for future replacement items and basic maintenance costs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S9</id><text>At the beginning of the 2025-07-03 session, the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 completed a gentle dynamic warm-up of jogging, joint-mobility work, and short accelerations under the supervision of head coach Marlen Tiravo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S10</id><text>The initial warm-up block for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03 lasted roughly 12 minutes and took place in two staggered lines running the length of the court, with exercises such as hip-openers, arm swings, and side shuffles interspersed between light jogs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S11</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo walked slowly along the sideline during the warm-up on 2025-07-03, occasionally stopping a player to adjust posture or stride length and reminding the group that the day\u2019s focus was on \u201cwaking the body up, not testing limits.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S12</id><text>Following the warm-up on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo organized Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 into small groups for individual ball-control stations that emphasized toe-touches, rolls, and turns using the new futsal balls supplied by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S13</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo divided the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players into three groups spread across half the court, rotating them every three minutes between stations that focused on fast toe-taps, sole rolls over five-meter lanes, and tight 180-degree turns around cones.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S14</id><text>During the ball-control segment on 2025-07-03, captain Mikel Ardan and flank player Sera Noll were asked by head coach Marlen Tiravo to demonstrate a sequence of inside-outside touches at one station before the rest of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 repeated the pattern at a slower tempo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S15</id><text>During the middle phase of the 2025-07-03 practice, fitness coach Kelran Dov led Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 through low-intensity agility patterns over the new ladders and mini-hurdles to reintroduce movement mechanics without imposing heavy physical load.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S16</id><text>The agility phase run by fitness coach Kelran Dov on 2025-07-03 featured simple in-in-out foot patterns through the ladders, lateral shuffles, and single-step hops over the mini-hurdles, with each repetition kept to 10\u201312 seconds followed by at least 30 seconds of rest.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S17</id><text>Fitness coach Kelran Dov carried a clipboard during the agility work for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17, jotting brief notes on knee alignment and upper-body control while offering verbal cues such as \u201csoft landings\u201d and \u201ceyes forward\u201d after each short set.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S18</id><text>In the final third of the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo set up the portable goals so that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 could perform relaxed finishing exercises with minimal defensive pressure and an emphasis on clean technique.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S19</id><text>For the finishing drills on 2025-07-03, the two portable goals were placed about nine meters from the end lines on opposite sides of the court, and Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players worked in pairs combining a wall pass and a controlled first touch before shooting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo encouraged the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players to alternate between dominant and weaker feet during the finishing segment and frequently stopped sequences to praise composed body shape or a well-placed low shot into the corners.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S21</id><text>At a brief pause before the last exercise block on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo told the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 that pressing drills and transition games would be deliberately postponed until the following week so that the team could first adjust to the new equipment.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S22</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the squad gathered around, head coach Marlen Tiravo explained that he wanted Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to \u201clearn exactly how these balls move on the floor before we ask you to sprint and press again,\u201d prompting several players to nod in agreement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S23</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also reminded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the pause that the concepts from the recent \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d article would still be part of the upcoming training cycle, but that 2025-07-03 was intended as a technical reset rather than an intense tactical session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S24</id><text>Toward the end of the 2025-07-03 training, goalkeeper Ren Talvek completed a short series of catching and distribution routines with the new futsal balls under the guidance of head coach Marlen Tiravo to assess the bounce and grip for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S25</id><text>Goalkeeper Ren Talvek\u2019s short block of work on 2025-07-03 included sets of low driven shots along the floor, high looping balls dropped from head coach Marlen Tiravo\u2019s hands, and side-arm throws toward marked zones near the touchline to test both handling and passing range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S26</id><text>After one sequence in which a shot skimmed off his gloves, goalkeeper Ren Talvek commented to head coach Marlen Tiravo that the new futsal balls felt \u201ca touch livelier off the surface\u201d than the previous batch, and the pair briefly discussed adjusting his stance for low saves.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S27</id><text>After the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo sent a brief email from the office of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy to development coordinator Neris Dalvo at Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council to report that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 had begun using the funded equipment and to thank Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council for the support.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S28</id><text>The email from head coach Marlen Tiravo to development coordinator Neris Dalvo was sent shortly after 17:15 on 2025-07-03 under the subject line \u201cEquipment grant update \u2013 Grendale U17\u201d and included two attached photographs of the new futsal balls and agility layout on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy indoor court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S29</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also copied the academy director on the 2025-07-03 message to Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, noting in one paragraph that the lighter session had helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 return from a short post-championship break without overloading the players.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>",

Only N2-S1 provides the start time of the training window, and only N2-S28 provides the reference time for the email. No other sentences in the outline give this combination of information.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the elapsed time in minutes between the start of the 90-minute training window and the moment the email was sent, under a defined assumption for \u201cshortly after.\u201d\n- N2-S1 is required to know the training start time (15:30).\n- N2-S28 is required to know the email\u2019s reference time (17:15) and the phrase \u201cshortly after,\u201d which, together with the assumption, gives 17:20.\n- Without N2-S1, you can\u2019t get the start time; without N2-S28, you can\u2019t get the email time. No other sentences give this pair of times.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Training start: 2025-07-03 15:30 (from N2-S1).\n- Email time (with assumption): \u201cshortly after 17:15\u201d = 5 minutes after 17:15 = 17:20 (from N2-S28 plus assumption).\n- Duration from 15:30 to 17:20:\n  - 15:30 \u2192 16:30 = 60 minutes\n  - 16:30 \u2192 17:20 = 50 minutes\n  - Total = 60 + 50 = 110 minutes\n\nSo, under the stated assumption, 110 minutes elapsed between the start of the training window and the email being sent.</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the previous response against the instructions:\n\n1. **Use of selected sentences only (N2-S1, N2-S28)**  \n   - N2-S1 uniquely provides:\n     - The existence of a **90-minute training window**.\n     - The **start time (15:30)** and **end time (17:00)** on the relevant day.\n   - N2-S28 uniquely provides:\n     - That an **email was sent the same day**.\n     - The phrase **\u201cshortly after 17:15\u201d**, which anchors the email\u2019s time of day.\n   - The question explicitly references:\n     - \u201ca 90-minute indoor training window\u201d \u2192 ties uniquely to N2-S1.\n     - \u201cthe phrase \u2018shortly after\u2019 in the description of when the email was sent\u201d \u2192 ties uniquely to N2-S28.\n   - No other sentences in the complete outline refer to this exact 90-minute window nor to an email sent \u201cshortly after\u201d a specified time, so no other sentence can substitute for either selected one. The question cannot be answered without both sentences.\n\n2. **Absolute times and assumptions**\n   - For N2-S1:\n     - Event date: 2025-07-03 (from the event section).\n     - Training start: 2025-07-03 15:30.\n     - Training end: 2025-07-03 17:00 (90-minute window).\n   - For N2-S28:\n     - Email time is described as \u201cshortly after 17:15\u201d on 2025-07-03.\n     - To get a precise computable time, the original response assumed **\u201cshortly after 17:15\u201d = exactly 5 minutes after 17:15**, i.e., 17:20.\n   - The instructions allow such assumptions provided they are:\n     - Explicitly stated.\n     - Incorporated into the question itself.\n   - The question clearly states this assumption: that \u201cshortly after\u201d means exactly 5 minutes after the specific time mentioned.\n\n3. **Avoiding explicit times in the question**\n   - The question does **not** mention 15:30 or 17:15 explicitly.\n   - It instead refers to:\n     - \u201cthe start of that training window\u201d (reader must extract start time from N2-S1).\n     - \u201cthe specific time mentioned there\u201d when describing the email (reader must extract 17:15 from N2-S28).\n   - This complies with the requirement to avoid directly including the temporal information in the question where possible.\n\n4. **Temporal reasoning requirement**\n   - To answer, the reader must:\n     - Identify from N2-S1 that the training starts at 15:30.\n     - Identify from N2-S28 that the email is sent \u201cshortly after 17:15.\u201d\n     - Apply the stated assumption that \u201cshortly after\u201d = 5 minutes after \u2192 email time = 17:20.\n     - Compute the difference from 15:30 to 17:20.\n   - This clearly requires temporal reasoning and the use of both selected sentences.\n\n5. **Answer format**\n   - Instructions require that the answer:\n     - Be a precise duration.\n     - Not be a full sentence.\n   - The answer \u201c110 minutes\u201d satisfies this.\n\n6. **Duration computation check**\n   - Start: 15:30.\n   - Email: 17:20 (17:15 + 5 minutes, per assumption).\n   - 15:30 \u2192 16:30 = 60 minutes.\n   - 16:30 \u2192 17:20 = 50 minutes.\n   - Total = 60 + 50 = 110 minutes.\n   - Calculation is correct.\n\n7. **Need for additional sentences**\n   - No additional sentences are required:\n     - The date and times needed are fully contained in N2-S1 and N2-S28.\n     - The event date (2025-07-03) is explicitly present in those sentences, so we do not need to rely on the broader event header.\n\nConclusion:  \nThe original question and answer adhere to all specified constraints.

    "SCRATCHPAD": "<scratchpad>\n[Sentence ID]: N2-S7\n- Time information:\n  - The order for the new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment was placed on 2025-06-30.\n  - The same order was delivered to the facility on the afternoon of 2025-07-02.\n- Event date: 2025-07-03 (for the whole N2 event block), but here we have more specific earlier dates.\nAssumptions:\n- \u201cPlaced \u2026 on 2025-06-30\u201d refers to some time during that calendar day; for counting days between dates, the exact time of day is irrelevant.\n- The equipment mentioned here is the exact same futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment later referenced in N2-S6 (same trio of items, same context of being tied to the development grant).\nAbsolute dates:\n- Order placement date: 2025-06-30.\n- Delivery date: 2025-07-02 (afternoon).\n\n[Sentence ID]: N2-S6\n- Time information:\n  - The futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment were used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03.\n  - These items had been purchased earlier in the week by the academy with part of the development grant from the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council.\n- Event date: 2025-07-03, which matches the explicit usage date in this sentence.\nAssumptions:\n- The equipment referenced here (\u201cfutsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment\u201d) is exactly the same equipment whose order and delivery are described in N2-S7.\n- We only need the calendar date of use (2025-07-03); no specific time of day is required, since the question will be framed in days, not hours.\nAbsolute dates:\n- First explicitly mentioned usage date: 2025-07-03.\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None needed. The required start point (order placement) and end point (training use) are fully specified by N2-S7 and N2-S6, including their linkage via the common description of the equipment and its funding source.\n- No other sentence in the outline both (a) gives the order-placement date and (b) ties the later under-17 training use explicitly to that ordered, grant-funded equipment, so N2-S7 and N2-S6 are jointly necessary.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Define a time span from:\n  - Start: the day when staff at Grendale Youth Futsal Academy placed the order with the Selvarin City sports supplier for the futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment (N2-S7).\n  - End: the day when those same items, bought with part of the development grant, were used in training by the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 squad (N2-S6).\n- Ask: \u201cHow many days passed between these two days?\u201d\n- This requires:\n  - N2-S7 to know the order-placement date.\n  - N2-S6 to know the specific date on which the ordered, grant-funded items were actually used by the under-17 squad.\n- No single sentence gives both endpoints; both must be read together. Other sentences may mention \u201cnew\u201d equipment or sessions on 2025-07-03, but they do not uniquely identify that this equipment was the one bought with part of the development grant and ordered from the Selvarin City supplier. The question will explicitly mention both \u201cplaced the order with the Selvarin City sports supplier\u201d (unique to N2-S7) and \u201cbought with part of the development grant\u201d / \u201cused by the under-17 squad in training\u201d (unique combination pointing to N2-S6).\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- From N2-S7:\n  - Order placement date = 2025-06-30.\n- From N2-S6:\n  - Training use date of that grant-funded equipment = 2025-07-03.\n\nCompute the elapsed time in days between 2025-06-30 and 2025-07-03:\n\n- 2025-06-30 \u2192 2025-07-01 = 1 day\n- 2025-07-01 \u2192 2025-07-02 = 1 day (cumulative 2 days)\n- 2025-07-02 \u2192 2025-07-03 = 1 day (cumulative 3 days)\n\nSo, the duration between the day the order was placed and the day the equipment was used in training by the under-17 squad is 3 days.\n\n</scratchpad>",
