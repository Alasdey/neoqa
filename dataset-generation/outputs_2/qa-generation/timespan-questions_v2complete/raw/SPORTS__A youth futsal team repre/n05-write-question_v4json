  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a complex question-answer pair based on a fictional event outline. Your goal is to create a question that asks about an absolute time span (duration) that can be computed using specific selected sentences from the outline.\n\nFirst, review the complete storyline outline:\n\n<complete_outline>\n{{STORYLINE_OUTLINE_TO_DATE}}\n</complete_outline>\n\nNow, focus on the selected sentences:\n\n<selected_sentences>\n{{SELECTED_SENTENCES}}\n</selected_sentences>\n\nTo create a time-span question based on the selected sentences, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the absolute date or time within each of the selected sentences if possible. If a sentence doesn't provide additional time information, use the event date as time information. Remember that the dates of individual sub-events within each event may differ from the event date. To compute the specific points in time, check if the selected sentences specify any of the following:\n   - Relative time information (e.g., \"six weeks ago\", \"in five days\", \"after two hours\") based on which you can compute a specific point in time\n   - Absolute time information (e.g., \"10:00 am\", \"March 22nd\")\n   - You can always assume that the date listed for each event is known. The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. \n   - If the specific points in time cannot be asserted with certainty but only estimated based on some likelihood, specify assumptions under which you can derive absolute points in time\n   - If the sentences describe durations, list the respective start and end dates/times together with the assumptions\n\n2. Think about the different options of absolute points of time and which time span between them would be most challenging to compute, ensuring that all selected sentences are required to compute the duration.\n\n3. Draft a specific question that asks for the time duration. This question can only be solved if one derives the absolute points in time from each of the selected sentences. The question must always ask about the duration between two points in time. Prefer time durations that differ from the absolute durations of the respective event (if multiple options of different possible ways to compute durations exist).\n\n4. Formulate a precise and correct answer to the question, which must be an absolute duration. Only use the information from the selected sentences and make the question very specific to avoid ambiguities. In the scratchpad, include a derivation of the answer using the absolute dates you estimated before.\n\n5. Ensure the validity of the questions:\n   - Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present.\n   - Make sure that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n   - Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to answer the question and that no other sentence from the <complete_outline> can replace any of the selected sentence in answering the question.\n   - Adjust the question accordingly to fulfill these criteria by making it more specific.\n\n6. Avoid absolute dates or times in your question if possible:\n   - If you needed to make an assumption about when something happened, try to explain it relative to other existing events or information from the <complete_outline>. Try to replace explicitly mentioned dates by anchoring them into some content of the <complete_outline> instead. If necessary, add the additional required sentence ID to your result and explain the unique information of this sentence that is necessary.\n   - Make sure that temporal reasoning is still required in the revised question. Double-check if the temporal information is still essential to answer the question after resolving the absolute dates. Think about different options (like start and end dates) to make sure that one must apply temporal reasoning to answer the question.\n\n7. If you must integrate additional information beyond what is specified within the selected sentences:\n   - Identify the unique information you must add to the question within the provided <complete_outline> and select the sentence communicating this unique information\n   - Explain what kind of unique information from this sentence is needed and why\n   - List the sentence ID of the newly selected sentence in your result\n   - Rewrite your question accordingly and ensure that all points listed in step 5 are valid when adding the newly selected sentence\n\nProvide your reasoning in the following format:\n<scratchpad>\n(Repeat for all sentence IDs)\n[Sentence ID]:\n- [Describe the time information from this sentence]\n- [Identify the event date]\nAssumptions:\n- [Make your assumptions explicit]\nAbsolute dates:\n- [List all relevant absolute dates from this sentence. Justify how they relate to the event date or other date information.]\n\n\nAdditional sentences:\n[Think about additional sentence IDs to add and explain your decision and what information from the sentence you require. List any new absolute dates based on this information.]\n\nQuestion Idea:\n[Outline how to create a challenging time-span question based on the absolute dates and selected information]\n- [For each selected sentence, specifically elaborate the unique information from this sentence that is required to answer the question. Think about how to frame the question without explicitly stating this unique information.]\n\n[Answer derivation]:\nCompute the answer using the absolute dates from above.\n\n<scratchpad>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<qa>\n<question>[Your generated question about the time span]</question>\n<answer>[The precise and concise answer to the question]</answer>\n<additional_sentence_ids>[List of additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, if applicable]</additional_sentence_ids>\n<additional_sentence_explanation>[Explain the unique information of each additional sentence that is required to answer the question and justify why it is needed, if applicable]</additional_sentence_explanation>\n</qa>\n</results>\n\nRemember to make your question as specific as possible, ensuring that it can only be answered using the information from the selected sentences (and any additional sentences you may need to include). If you need to make assumptions, state them clearly in the question. Always provide a precise and concise answer to the question you generate.\n\nImportant reminders:\n- While each event provides a unique date, which can be helpful to identify the question, the provided date does not necessarily apply to all information listed in the event outline (or the selected sentences extracted from the event outline). The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. Think carefully about how the event date applies to the selected sentences before you start drafting your question. Some events may have happened in the past even though they are not described in the past tense. Use your common sense and the sequence of sentences within the event. If you are reasonably uncertain, make your assumption explicit and include it in your question.\n- Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present, and that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n- Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to infer the correct answer.\n- If you need to include additional sentences, clearly explain why they are necessary and what unique information they provide.\n- In your question clearly indicate if some point in time happens in the future as such (for example when including the planned end date of an ongoing or planned event).\n- In your question, DO NOT include the required temporal information. The temporal information must be inferred from the content of the selected sentences.\n- DO NOT create questions about time-spans that mix units that cannot be compared in a meaningful way (such as minutes and days, days and years).\n- If you make assumptions, make sure they are plausible.\n- If you rely on the event date, carefully assess if the whether the information likely occurred before or after the event date.\n- State your assumptions that are required to answer the question clearly in the question.\n- Make sure that the question cannot be answered without considering unique content from ALL selected evidence sentences (from <selected_sentences> and <additional_sentence_ids>)\n- Explicitly compute and list all dates, including start and end dates, based on your assumptions before you draft your question.\n- The answer should only consist of the correct time span and should not be a complete sentence.\n- Ensure that you DO NOT explicitly refer to absolute dates or relative time spans (from the selected sentences) in the question. It is important that answering the question requires extracting this information from these sentences.",

coaches.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S16</id><text>The \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d piece filled four magazine pages and broke the concept into three progressive training blocks, each specifying recommended pitch dimensions, work-to-rest ratios, and suggested adaptations for under-13, under-15, and under-17 age groups.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S17</id><text>A highlighted sidebar within the article quoted head coach Marlen Tiravo explaining how a simple verbal cue of \u201cstep and cover\u201d helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players coordinate their movements when initiating the paired press in competitive matches.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S18</id><text>On the afternoon of 2025-06-30, head coach Marlen Tiravo held a classroom-style review session at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy training facility where Marlen Tiravo distributed copies of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series by Lina Veress to the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S19</id><text>The review session took place in a small upstairs meeting room overlooking the indoor training court, with around a dozen players seated at desks while head coach Marlen Tiravo used a whiteboard and a projector to walk through key diagrams from the magazine.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo asked each player of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to highlight at least one paragraph that reflected their own habits, leading to a brief discussion in which several players expressed surprise at seeing their off-the-ball work described in print.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S21</id><text>By the evening of 2025-06-30, several school futsal coaches in Selvarin City, including Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach Harven Soll, reported using the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly articles by Lina Veress as practical reference material for planning upcoming youth training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S22</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 marked specific drills from \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d with sticky notes in his planning notebook and penciled them into his July pre-season schedule as alternatives to his standard defensive warm-up routines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S23</id><text>Other coaches in Selvarin City mentioned in informal messages to editor Ralen Ko that they appreciated the clear field diagrams and ready-made session plans, which allowed them to adapt Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 concepts without having to design exercises from scratch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S24</id><text>In a brief comment published alongside the feature series on 2025-06-30, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council development coordinator Neris Dalvo stated that Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council did not plan to produce separate official school case-study booklets about the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 title run.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S25</id><text>The note from development coordinator Neris Dalvo appeared in a shaded \u201cCouncil Perspective\u201d box at the bottom of the first feature page, where Neris Dalvo cited limited staff capacity and a preference for issuing broader coaching guidelines rather than detailed profiles of single teams.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S26</id><text>In the same comment, development coordinator Neris Dalvo nevertheless thanked Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 for setting \u201ca positive standard for preparation and sportsmanship\u201d and expressed support for independent publications that highlighted constructive youth coaching practices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S27</id><text>Despite the absence of dedicated case-study materials from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, local coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone and broader Selvarin City began informally treating the series by Lina Veress in Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly as a de facto reference document for youth futsal training discussions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S28</id><text>During informal planning conversations and email exchanges on 2025-06-30, several coaches referred to specific pages of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly issue\u2014such as the transition-attack diagram on page 11\u2014as shorthand examples when debating how aggressively to press with teenage players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S29</id><text>Some coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone scanned or photographed selected layouts from the feature series and shared them within small staff groups, using the material as a common visual basis for adjusting their own session content rather than as any kind of official curriculum.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-03</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N2-S0</id><text>On 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo led a 90-minute low-pressure afternoon

and newly appointed fitness coach Kelran Dov arranged the new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment along one side of the indoor court of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy for use by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S4</id><text>The equipment layout prepared by head coach Marlen Tiravo and fitness coach Kelran Dov on 2025-07-03 included a neat row of twelve white-and-blue size-4 futsal balls, two collapsible 2-by-3-meter portable goals, two flat agility ladders, and eight low yellow mini-hurdles positioned just inside the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S5</id><text>Fitness coach Kelran Dov, who had formally joined the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 staff at the start of July after previously assisting with younger age groups at the academy, took several minutes to check ball inflation with a handheld pressure gauge before the players stepped onto the court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S6</id><text>The futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03 had been purchased earlier in the week by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy with part of the development grant previously awarded by Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S7</id><text>According to staff at Grendale Youth Futsal Academy, the order for the new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment had been placed with a Selvarin City sports supplier on 2025-06-30 and delivered to the Grendale Suburban Zone facility on the afternoon of 2025-07-02.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S8</id><text>Around two-thirds of the 3,000-selvars development grant from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council was allocated to the equipment package used on 2025-07-03, with the remaining funds at Grendale Youth Futsal Academy earmarked for future replacement items and basic maintenance costs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S9</id><text>At the beginning of the 2025-07-03 session, the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 completed a gentle dynamic warm-up of jogging, joint-mobility work, and short accelerations under the supervision of head coach Marlen Tiravo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S10</id><text>The initial warm-up block for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03 lasted roughly 12 minutes and took place in two staggered lines running the length of the court, with exercises such as hip-openers, arm swings, and side shuffles interspersed between light jogs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S11</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo walked slowly along the sideline during the warm-up on 2025-07-03, occasionally stopping a player to adjust posture or stride length and reminding the group that the day\u2019s focus was on \u201cwaking the body up, not testing limits.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S12</id><text>Following the warm-up on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo organized Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 into small groups for individual ball-control stations that emphasized toe-touches, rolls, and turns using the new futsal balls supplied by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S13</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo divided the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players into three groups spread across half the court, rotating them every three minutes between stations that focused on fast toe-taps, sole rolls over five-meter lanes, and tight 180-degree turns around cones.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S14</id><text>During the ball-control segment on 2025-07-03, captain Mikel Ardan and flank player Sera Noll were asked by head coach Marlen Tiravo to demonstrate a sequence of inside-outside touches at one station before the rest of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 repeated the pattern at a slower tempo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S15</id><text>During the middle phase of the 2025-07-03 practice, fitness coach Kelran Dov led Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 through low-intensity agility patterns over the new ladders and mini-hurdles to reintroduce movement mechanics without imposing heavy physical load.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S16</id><text>The agility phase run by fitness coach Kelran Dov on 2025-07-03 featured simple in-in-out foot patterns through the ladders, lateral shuffles, and single-step hops over the mini-hurdles, with each repetition kept to 10\u201312 seconds followed by at least 30 seconds of rest.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S17</id><text>Fitness coach Kelran Dov carried a clipboard during the agility work for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17, jotting brief notes on knee alignment and upper-body control while offering verbal cues such as \u201csoft landings\u201d and \u201ceyes forward\u201d after each short set.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S18</id><text>In the final third of the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo set up the portable goals so that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 could perform relaxed finishing exercises with minimal defensive pressure and an emphasis on clean technique.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S19</id><text>For the finishing drills on 2025-07-03, the two portable goals were placed about nine meters from the end lines on opposite sides of the court, and Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players worked in pairs combining a wall pass and a controlled first touch before shooting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo encouraged the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players to alternate between dominant and weaker feet during the finishing segment and frequently stopped sequences to praise composed body shape or a well-placed low shot into the corners.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S21</id><text>At a brief pause before the last exercise block on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo told the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 that pressing drills and transition games would be deliberately postponed until the following week so that the team could first adjust to the new equipment.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S22</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the squad gathered around, head coach Marlen Tiravo explained that he wanted Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to \u201clearn exactly how these balls move on the floor before we ask you to sprint and press again,\u201d prompting several players to nod in agreement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S23</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also reminded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the pause that the concepts from the recent \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d article would still be part of the upcoming training cycle, but that 2025-07-03 was intended as a technical reset rather than an intense tactical session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S24</id><text>Toward the end of the 2025-07-03 training, goalkeeper Ren Talvek completed a short series of catching and distribution routines with the new futsal balls under the guidance of head coach Marlen Tiravo to assess the bounce and grip for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S25</id><text>Goalkeeper Ren Talvek\u2019s short block of work on 2025-07-03 included sets of low driven shots along the floor, high looping balls dropped from head coach Marlen Tiravo\u2019s hands, and side-arm throws toward marked zones near the touchline to test both handling and passing range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S26</id><text>After one sequence in which a shot skimmed off his gloves, goalkeeper Ren Talvek commented to head coach Marlen Tiravo that the new futsal balls felt \u201ca touch livelier off the surface\u201d than the previous batch, and the pair briefly discussed adjusting his stance for low saves.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S27</id><text>After the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo sent a brief email from the office of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy to development coordinator Neris Dalvo at Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council to report that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 had begun using the funded equipment and to thank Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council for the support.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S28</id><text>The email from head coach Marlen Tiravo to development coordinator Neris Dalvo was sent shortly after 17:15 on 2025-07-03 under the subject line \u201cEquipment grant update \u2013 Grendale U17\u201d and included two attached photographs of the new futsal balls and agility layout on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy indoor court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S29</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also copied the academy director on the 2025-07-03 message to Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, noting in one paragraph that the lighter session had helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 return from a short post-championship break without overloading the players.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-12</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N3-S0</id><text>On 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 hosted Varlen Crest Futsal Club

Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 student volunteer beside the court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S2</id><text>Around 35 spectators, mainly classmates, a few parents, and two teachers from the Meadowlane Quarter of Selvarin City, watched from the single row of retractable bleachers that runs along one touchline of the indoor court of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S3</id><text>Before the warm-up on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll gathered the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a short meeting to explain that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 would apply ideas from the article Pressing in Pairs by Lina Veress during the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S4</id><text>The pre-match meeting for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 took place in a narrow changing room beside the indoor court, where coach Harven Soll held up a printed copy of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly opened to the Pressing in Pairs diagrams and pointed out the roles of the first and second defender to the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll emphasized to Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that the goal of the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 was to communicate clearly and stay compact in the press, telling the squad that \u201cthe result matters less today than whether we move together in twos.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S6</id><text>During the pre-match warm-up on 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 ran their first on-court version of a paired pressing shadow drill adapted from Pressing in Pairs under the direct supervision of coach Harven Soll.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S7</id><text>In the paired pressing shadow drill, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players worked in twos along the halfway line, sliding sideways in unison to close imaginary passing lanes while coach Harven Soll shouted cues such as \u201cstep and cover\u201d and \u201cshow outside\u201d from just inside the center circle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S8</id><text>The overall warm-up for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 lasted about 18 minutes and combined the new shadow pressing movements with a brief four-versus-one rondo and a short shooting sequence before Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began its own preparations on the opposite half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S9</id><text>In the opening half of the 2025-07-12 friendly, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 kept the score 0\u20130 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 repeatedly used two-player presses to force the ball toward the sidelines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S10</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 set up in a 2\u20132 defensive shape for most of the first half and repeatedly angled pressure toward the left sideline, funneling Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into rushed passes that rolled harmlessly over the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S11</id><text>Although the score remained 0\u20130 before halftime, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 managed three shots on target compared with one clear chance for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, whose close-range effort was beaten away at the near post by the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S12</id><text>Early in the second half on 2025-07-12, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger finished a fast counterattack from the right side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S13</id><text>The opening goal for Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived roughly three minutes after the restart when a misplaced square pass by a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender near the attacking third was intercepted and quickly relayed into a three-pass counter down the right flank.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S14</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger cut inside toward the edge of the area and drove a firm low shot across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall into the far corner, putting Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 ahead 1\u20130.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S15</id><text>Midway through the second half on 2025-07-12, wide player Talen Priev equalized for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to make the score 1\u20131 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 with a low left-footed shot after intercepting a pass near halfway.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S16</id><text>The goal by wide player Talen Priev came around the ninth minute of the second half when Talen Priev stepped into a lateral pass near the center circle as Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sprung a coordinated press from the left side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S17</id><text>After carrying the ball roughly ten meters under pressure from a retreating Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender, Talen Priev opened his body and slid a left-footed finish inside the near post, drawing loud applause from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 supporters on the bleachers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S18</id><text>Throughout the second half on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll noted from the bench that the back line of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 shifted laterally and covered central space more consistently when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 activated paired presses inspired by Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S19</id><text>From his seat on the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 bench, coach Harven Soll periodically scribbled arrows and short comments on a clipboard, marking how the two central defenders tucked in behind the ball whenever Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pushed a first presser toward the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S20</id><text>Several times as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 tried to build through the middle, coach Harven Soll pointed toward the top of the penalty area and shouted reminders such as \u201cprotect the middle\u201d and \u201cclose the gap,\u201d prompting the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 back line to narrow their spacing compared with earlier in the season.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S21</id><text>After the final whistle of the 1\u20131 draw on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll told the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a brief huddle that the Pressing in Pairs-oriented work had improved the defensive shape of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 still needed to react faster to long diagonal passes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S22</id><text>The post-match huddle for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 formed near the center circle, with the players standing in a tight semicircle around coach Harven Soll, sweat-soaked bibs pulled over their school jerseys as they listened quietly to the feedback.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S23</id><text>Coach Harven Soll singled out one late Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attack that had exposed the far-post area, telling Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that upcoming sessions would focus on getting the weak-side defender to drop earlier whenever the opponent shaped to play a diagonal switch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S24</id><text>Following the post-match team talk on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll and visiting coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed at courtside that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 would arrange a second friendly later in July to further test the new pressing structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S25</id><text>While players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 shook hands and gathered scattered balls, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos stood near the halfway line comparing open dates in the last two weeks of July in their pocket notebooks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S26</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos remarked to coach Harven Soll that the adjusted pressing of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had forced Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into more long passes than usual, and both coaches discussed the possibility of recording short video clips of the next friendly for a joint post-game review.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S27</id><text>Later in the evening of 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll updated the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to schedule Pressing in Pairs-based defensive blocks twice a week in the remaining July sessions for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 before the school league begins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S28</id><text>At a kitchen table in the Meadowlane Quarter that evening, coach Harven Soll spread out the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 match sheet and his color-coded training planner, penciling in 20-minute Pressing in Pairs segments on Tuesday and Thursday slots for the rest of July.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S29</id><text>In the margin of the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll wrote a reminder to pair the defensive blocks with short transition games focusing on reacting to diagonal passes and covering the back post as preparation for the upcoming school league fixtures.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-24</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N4-S0</id><text>On the afternoon of 2025-07-24, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived at Northline Community Sports Hall in Selvarin City for a scheduled full-length pre-season futsal rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S1</id><text>Both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 reached Northline Community Sports Hall shortly after 15:30 by a mix of school minibus and parent cars, aiming for a 16:00 kick-off within a 90-minute booking window.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S2</id><text>Northline Community Sports Hall offered a single full-size futsal court marked on light grey synthetic flooring under a high arched roof, with a small two-row bleacher section along one touchline where a handful of early-arriving parents took seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S3</id><text>Shortly after Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began changing at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos noticed a steady leak in the roof dripping onto one end of the futsal court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S4</id><text>The leak at Northline Community Sports Hall was first noticed when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 substitute heard drops hitting the floor near the far goalmouth and called coach Deren Kavos over while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were still pulling on their socks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S5</id><text>Within a few minutes, a palm-sized wet patch had formed just inside the penalty area line at one end of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, with water steadily dripping from a seam in the metal roof despite the hall attendant placing a plastic bucket nearby.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S6</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked the playing area at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed that the wet patch and spreading moisture made a standard forty-minute futsal match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 unsafe.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S7</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked slowly from sideline to sideline at Northline Community Sports Hall, testing the surface with the soles of their trainers and noting that the damp section already extended roughly four meters into the playing area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S8</id><text>After briefly consulting the hall attendant at Northline Community Sports Hall about the likelihood of the leak stopping and hearing that it had been a recurring issue during recent rain showers, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos concluded that any full-speed sprints toward that goal would pose too much risk of slipping.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos decided to mark off the damp third of the floor at Northline Community Sports Hall with cones and to shorten the available playing space so that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could still complete a controlled training session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S10</id><text>Using a set of bright orange flat cones brought by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and yellow dome cones from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos created a clear no-entry zone that effectively shortened the court to about two-thirds of its normal length at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S11</id><text>While coach Harven Soll quickly crossed out his planned full-match structure in his notebook and jotted down revised timings for drill blocks, coach Deren Kavos explained to a small cluster of puzzled players that the session at Northline Community Sports Hall would emphasize decision-making and pressing rather than match intensity.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S12</id><text>Before starting any ball work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 carried out a joint warm-up on the dry half of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, focusing on light mobility exercises and simple two-player passing patterns.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S13</id><text>The joint warm-up at Northline Community Sports Hall lasted around 15 minutes and began with slow jogging, hip-openers, ankle rolls, and arm swings led by coach Harven Soll before coach Deren Kavos introduced short side shuffles and gentle backward skips.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S14</id><text>After the mobility work at Northline Community Sports Hall, the two coaches paired players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 together in five-meter channels along the sideline to exchange firm right-foot and left-foot passes while calling each other\u2019s names to encourage communication.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S15</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos set up a camera identified as a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a fixed tripod at midcourt in Northline Community Sports Hall to record joint paired-pressing drills by Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 based on concepts from the article Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S16</id><text>The Ravelin VX-2 camcorder belonged to Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and had been brought to Northline Community Sports Hall in a padded black case, with coach Deren Kavos checking that the battery indicator was full and that a 32-gigabyte memory card provided enough space for the afternoon\u2019s work.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S17</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos positioned the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder at midcourt atop the second row of the bleachers at Northline Community Sports Hall, angling the lens slightly downward so the frame captured the entire dry half and the touchline along which the presses would be directed.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S18</id><text>In the main training block, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 mixed players into two balanced squads and ran repeated short sequences in which the first and second defender executed Pressing in Pairs cues toward the sideline while the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder captured every repetition.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S19</id><text>The mixed squads at Northline Community Sports Hall were balanced so that each included two regular defenders, two attackers, and a goalkeeper from across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, with colored bibs used to distinguish the sides regardless of school kit.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S20</id><text>During the main training block at Northline Community Sports Hall, sequences typically lasted 6 to 8 seconds as two defenders snapped into a coordinated press against three circulating attackers, after which coach Harven Soll or coach Deren Kavos would briefly freeze the play to reposition body angles or remind players of the \u201cstep and cover\u201d cue before restarting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S21</id><text>To conclude the on-court work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 played a single twelve-minute mixed-squad training game on the reduced court at Northline Community Sports Hall with informal rules that rewarded successful paired presses instead of keeping a formal score.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S22</id><text>For the twelve-minute mixed-squad training game at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches dubbed the teams \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cGreen\u201d based on bib color and instructed the players that each successful paired press in the attacking half earning a clear turnover would count as one point, even though no official scoreboard was used.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S23</id><text>To reduce physical strain on the shortened court at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches agreed on roll-on substitutions and relaxed restart rules, allowing quick kick-ins from the sidelines so that the flow of play remained centered on creating and responding to pressing situations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S24</id><text>After the session, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos reviewed a brief segment of the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder footage on the camera screen at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed to share the full recording between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 for a joint video-review meeting the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S25</id><text>After the final whistle at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos gathered near the tripod and replayed a 30-second clip in which a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arrived late as the second presser, using the pause button on the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to highlight spacing issues to the small group of nearby players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S26</id><text>Coach Harven Soll offered to copy the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder file from Northline Community Sports Hall onto a portable USB drive and to upload a version to a shared online folder so that both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could access the footage during the joint review planned for the middle of the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S27</id><text>Before leaving Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Deren Kavos and coach Harven Soll confirmed a new date in early August for a full rematch between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, explaining the revised plan to the assembled players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S28</id><text>In confirming the rearranged match at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos suggested an early-evening weekday slot in the first full week of August so that parents could attend after work, and coach Harven Soll checked his paper planner before nodding and noting the time beside the new fixture entry.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S29</id><text>As the players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered around at Northline Community Sports Hall to hear the explanation, several expressed disappointment at missing out on a full match that day, but both coaches stressed that the safer surface and additional video preparation would help make the

defender.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S10</id><text>The selected clip from the 2025-07-24 recording showed a Blue-bibbed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arriving slightly square to the touchline on the right side, and coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 replayed the five-second action twice so everyone could see how that angle affected the trap.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S11</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pointed toward the projected image with the cap of his marker and asked the mixed group whether the second defender\u2019s front foot should be pointing more toward the ball or more toward the center, inviting short, one-word answers from the front row.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S12</id><text>During a paused frame of the same sequence, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 used a whiteboard in the Varlen Crest Training Hall

\u201c1.5 steps gap\u201d and \u201cbody half-open\u201d beside the second defender\u2019s symbol, explaining that this spacing allowed quick cover if the opponent cut inside or played a bounce pass back toward the middle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S15</id><text>In a later segment of the video, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 highlighted a passage where Varlen Crest

Identify the absolute date or time within each of the selected sentences if possible. If a sentence doesn't provide additional time information, use the event date as time information. Remember that the dates of individual sub-events within each event may differ from the event date. To compute the specific points in time, check if the selected sentences specify any of the following:\n   - Relative time information (e.g., \"six weeks ago\", \"in five days\", \"after two hours\") based on which you can compute a specific point in time\n   - Absolute time information (e.g., \"10:00 am\", \"March 22nd\")\n   - You can always assume that the date listed for each event is known. The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. \n   - If the specific points in time cannot be asserted with certainty but only estimated based on some likelihood, specify assumptions under which you can derive absolute points in time\n   - If the sentences describe durations, list the respective start and end dates/times together with the assumptions\n\n2. Think about the different options of absolute points of time and which time span between them would be most challenging to compute, ensuring that all selected sentences are required to compute the duration.\n\n3. Draft a specific question that asks for the time duration. This question can only be solved if one derives the absolute points in time from each of the selected sentences. The question must always ask about the duration between two points in time. Prefer time durations that differ from the absolute durations of the respective event (if multiple options of different possible ways to compute durations exist).\n\n4. Formulate a precise and correct answer to the question, which must be an absolute duration. Only use the information from the selected sentences and make the question very specific to avoid ambiguities. In the scratchpad, include a derivation of the answer using the absolute dates you estimated before.\n\n5. Ensure the validity of the questions:\n   - Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present.\n   - Make sure that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n   - Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to answer the question and that no other sentence from the <complete_outline> can replace any of the selected sentence in answering the question.\n   - Adjust the question accordingly to fulfill these criteria by making it more specific.\n\n6. Avoid absolute dates or times in your question if possible:\n   - If you needed to make an assumption about when something happened, try to explain it relative to other existing events or information from the <complete_outline>. Try to replace explicitly mentioned dates by anchoring them into some content of the <complete_outline> instead. If necessary, add the additional required sentence ID to your result and explain the unique information of this sentence that is necessary.\n   - Make sure that temporal reasoning is still required in the revised question. Double-check if the temporal information is still essential to answer the question after resolving the absolute dates. Think about different options (like start and end dates) to make sure that one must apply temporal reasoning to answer the question.\n\n7. If you must integrate additional information beyond what is specified within the selected sentences:\n   - Identify the unique information you must add to the question within the provided <complete_outline> and select the sentence communicating this unique information\n   - Explain what kind of unique information from this sentence is needed and why\n   - List the sentence ID of the newly selected sentence in your result\n   - Rewrite your question accordingly and ensure that all points listed in step 5 are valid when adding the newly selected sentence\n\nProvide your reasoning in the following format:\n<scratchpad>\n(Repeat for all sentence IDs)\n[Sentence ID]:\n- [Describe the time information from this sentence]\n- [Identify the event date]\nAssumptions:\n- [Make your assumptions explicit]\nAbsolute dates:\n- [List all relevant absolute dates from this sentence. Justify how they relate to the event date or other date information.]\n\n\nAdditional sentences:\n[Think about additional sentence IDs to add and explain your decision and what information from the sentence you require. List any new absolute dates based on this information.]\n\nQuestion Idea:\n[Outline how to create a challenging time-span question based on the absolute dates and selected information]\n- [For each selected sentence, specifically elaborate the unique information from this sentence that is required to answer the question. Think about how to frame the question without explicitly stating this unique information.]\n\n[Answer derivation]:\nCompute the answer using the absolute dates from above.\n\n<scratchpad>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<qa>\n<question>[Your generated question about the time span]</question>\n<answer>[The precise and concise answer to the question]</answer>\n<additional_sentence_ids>[List of additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, if applicable]</additional_sentence_ids>\n<additional_sentence_explanation>[Explain the unique information of each additional sentence that is required to answer the question and justify why it is needed, if applicable]</additional_sentence_explanation>\n</qa>\n</results>\n\nRemember to make your question as specific as possible, ensuring that it can only be answered using the information from the selected sentences (and any additional sentences you may need to include). If you need to make assumptions, state them clearly in the question. Always provide a precise and concise answer to the question you generate.\n\nImportant reminders:\n- While each event provides a unique date, which can be helpful to identify the question, the provided date does not necessarily apply to all information listed in the event outline (or the selected sentences extracted from the event outline). The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. Think carefully about how the event date applies to the selected sentences before you start drafting your question. Some events may have happened in the past even though they are not described in the past tense. Use your common sense and the sequence of sentences within the event. If you are reasonably uncertain, make your assumption explicit and include it in your question.\n- Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present, and that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n- Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to infer the correct answer.\n- If you need to include additional sentences, clearly explain why they are necessary and what unique information they provide.\n- In your question clearly indicate if some point in time happens in the future as such (for example when including the planned end date of an ongoing or planned event).\n- In your question, DO NOT include the required temporal information. The temporal information must be inferred from the content of the selected sentences.\n- DO NOT create questions about time-spans that mix units that cannot be compared in a meaningful way (such as minutes and days, days and years).\n- If you make assumptions, make sure they are plausible.\n- If you rely on the event date, carefully assess if the whether the information likely occurred before or after the event date.\n- State your assumptions that are required to answer the question clearly in the question.\n- Make sure that the question cannot be answered without considering unique content from ALL selected evidence sentences (from <selected_sentences> and <additional_sentence_ids>)\n- Explicitly compute and list all dates, including start and end dates, based on your assumptions before you draft your question.\n- The answer should only consist of the correct time span and should not be a complete sentence.\n- Ensure that you DO NOT explicitly refer to absolute dates or relative time spans (from the selected sentences) in the question. It is important that answering the question requires extracting this information from these sentences.",

players to nod in agreement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S23</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also reminded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the pause that the concepts from the recent

short block of work on 2025-07-03 included sets of low driven shots along the floor, high looping balls dropped from head coach Marlen Tiravo\u2019s hands, and side-arm throws toward marked zones near

players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll emphasized to Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that the goal of the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 was to

twos.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S6</id><text>During the pre-match warm-up on 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 ran their first on-court version of a paired pressing shadow drill adapted from Pressing in Pairs under the direct supervision of coach Harven Soll.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S7</id><text>In the paired pressing shadow drill, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players worked in twos along the halfway line, sliding sideways in unison to close imaginary passing lanes while coach Harven Soll shouted cues such as \u201cstep and cover\u201d and \u201cshow outside\u201d from just inside the center circle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S8</id><text>The overall warm-up for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 lasted about 18 minutes and combined the new shadow

the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S11</id><text>Although the score remained 0\u20130 before halftime, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 managed three shots on target compared with one clear chance for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, whose close-range effort was beaten away at the near post by the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S12</id><text>Early in the second half on 2025-07-12, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when a

from a retreating Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender, Talen Priev opened his body and slid a left-footed finish inside the near post, drawing loud applause from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 supporters on the bleachers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S18</id><text>Throughout the second half on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll noted from the bench that the back line of Meadowlane School

Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S19</id><text>From his seat on the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 bench, coach Harven Soll periodically scribbled arrows and short comments on a clipboard,

the season.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S21</id><text>After the final whistle of the 1\u20131 draw on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll told the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a brief huddle that the Pressing in Pairs-oriented work had improved the defensive shape of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 still needed to react faster to long diagonal passes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S22</id><text>The post-match huddle for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 formed near the center circle, with the players standing in a tight semicircle around coach Harven Soll, sweat-soaked bibs pulled over their school jerseys as they listened quietly to the feedback.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S23</id><text>Coach Harven Soll singled out one late Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attack that had exposed the far-post area, telling Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that upcoming sessions would focus on getting the weak-side defender to drop earlier whenever the opponent shaped to play a diagonal switch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S24</id><text>Following the post-match team talk on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll and visiting coach Deren

test the new pressing structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S25</id><text>While players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 shook hands and gathered scattered

Deren Kavos remarked to coach Harven Soll that the adjusted pressing of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had forced Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into more long passes than usual, and both coaches discussed the possibility of recording short video clips of the next friendly for a joint post-game review.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S27</id><text>Later in the evening of 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll updated the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to schedule Pressing in Pairs-based defensive blocks twice a week in the remaining July sessions for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 before the school league begins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S28</id><text>At a kitchen table in the Meadowlane Quarter that evening, coach Harven Soll spread out the Meadowlane School

Futsal Club Under-17 arrived at Northline Community Sports Hall in Selvarin City for a scheduled full-length pre-season futsal rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S1</id><text>Both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 reached Northline Community Sports Hall shortly after 15:30 by a mix of school minibus and parent cars, aiming for a 16:00 kick-off within a 90-minute booking window.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S2</id><text>Northline Community Sports Hall offered a single full-size futsal court marked on light grey synthetic flooring under a high arched roof, with a small two-row bleacher section along one touchline where a handful of early-arriving parents took seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S3</id><text>Shortly after Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began changing at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos noticed a steady leak in the roof dripping onto one end of the futsal court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S4</id><text>The leak at Northline Community Sports Hall was first noticed when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 substitute heard drops hitting the floor near the far goalmouth and called coach Deren Kavos over while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were still pulling on their socks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S5</id><text>Within a few minutes, a palm-sized wet patch had formed just inside the penalty area line at one end of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, with water steadily dripping from a seam in the metal roof despite the hall attendant placing a plastic bucket nearby.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S6</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked the playing area at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed that the wet patch and spreading moisture made a standard forty-minute futsal match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 unsafe.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S7</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked slowly from sideline to sideline at Northline Community Sports Hall, testing the surface with the soles of their trainers and noting that the damp section already extended roughly four meters into the playing area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S8</id><text>After briefly consulting the hall attendant at Northline Community Sports Hall about the likelihood of the leak stopping and hearing that it had been a recurring issue during recent rain showers, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos concluded that any full-speed sprints toward that goal would pose too much risk of slipping.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos decided to mark off the damp third of the floor at Northline Community Sports Hall with cones and to shorten the available playing space so that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could still complete a controlled training session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S10</id><text>Using a set of bright orange flat cones brought by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and yellow dome cones from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos created a clear no-entry zone that effectively shortened the court to about two-thirds of its normal length at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S11</id><text>While coach Harven Soll quickly crossed out his planned full-match structure in his notebook and jotted down revised timings for drill blocks, coach Deren Kavos explained to a small cluster of puzzled players that the session at Northline Community Sports Hall would emphasize decision-making and pressing rather than match intensity.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S12</id><text>Before starting any ball work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 carried out a joint warm-up on the dry half of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, focusing on light mobility exercises and simple two-player passing patterns.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S13</id><text>The joint warm-up at Northline Community Sports Hall lasted around 15 minutes and began with slow jogging, hip-openers, ankle rolls, and arm swings led by coach Harven Soll before coach Deren Kavos introduced short side shuffles and gentle backward skips.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S14</id><text>After the mobility work at Northline Community Sports Hall, the two coaches paired players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 together in five-meter channels along the sideline to exchange firm right-foot and left-foot passes while calling each other\u2019s names to encourage communication.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S15</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos set up a camera identified as a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a fixed tripod at midcourt in Northline Community Sports Hall to record joint paired-pressing drills by Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 based on concepts from the article Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S16</id><text>The Ravelin VX-2 camcorder belonged to Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and had been brought to Northline Community Sports Hall in a padded black case, with coach Deren Kavos checking that the battery indicator was full and that a 32-gigabyte memory card provided enough space for the afternoon\u2019s work.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S17</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos positioned the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder at midcourt atop the second row of the bleachers at Northline Community Sports Hall, angling the lens slightly downward so the frame captured the entire dry half and the touchline along which the presses would be directed.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S18</id><text>In the main training block, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 mixed players into two balanced squads and ran repeated short sequences in which the first and second defender executed Pressing in Pairs cues toward the sideline while the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder captured every repetition.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S19</id><text>The mixed squads at Northline Community Sports Hall were balanced so that each included two regular defenders, two attackers, and a goalkeeper from across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, with colored bibs used to distinguish the sides regardless of school kit.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S20</id><text>During the main training block at Northline Community Sports Hall, sequences typically lasted 6 to 8 seconds as two defenders snapped into a coordinated press against three circulating attackers, after which coach Harven Soll or coach Deren Kavos would briefly freeze the play to reposition body angles or remind players of the \u201cstep and cover\u201d cue before restarting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S21</id><text>To conclude the on-court work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 played a single twelve-minute mixed-squad training game on the reduced court at Northline Community Sports Hall with informal rules that rewarded successful paired presses instead of keeping a formal score.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S22</id><text>For the twelve-minute mixed-squad training game at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches dubbed the teams \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cGreen\u201d based on bib color and instructed the players that each successful paired press in the attacking half earning a clear turnover would count as one point, even though no official scoreboard was used.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S23</id><text>To reduce physical strain on the shortened court at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches agreed on roll-on substitutions and relaxed restart rules, allowing quick kick-ins from the sidelines so that the flow of play remained centered on creating and responding to pressing situations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S24</id><text>After the session, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos reviewed a brief segment of the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder footage on the camera screen at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed to share the full recording between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 for a joint video-review meeting the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S25</id><text>After the final whistle at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos gathered near the tripod and replayed a 30-second clip in which a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arrived late as the second presser, using the pause button on the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to highlight spacing issues to the small group of nearby players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S26</id><text>Coach Harven Soll offered to copy the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder file from Northline Community Sports Hall onto a portable USB drive and to upload a version to a shared online folder so that both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could access the footage during the joint review planned for the middle of the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S27</id><text>Before leaving Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Deren Kavos and coach Harven Soll confirmed a new date in early August for a full rematch between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, explaining the revised plan to the assembled players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S28</id><text>In confirming the rearranged match at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos suggested an early-evening weekday slot in the first full week of August so that parents could attend after work, and coach Harven Soll checked his paper planner before nodding and noting the time beside the new fixture entry.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S29</id><text>As the players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered around at Northline Community Sports Hall to hear the explanation, several expressed disappointment at missing out on a full match that day, but both coaches stressed that the safer surface and additional video preparation would help make the August rematch more useful for everyone.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-29</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N5-S0</id><text>On the evening of 2025-07-29, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered in a meeting room at Varlen Crest Training Hall for a joint video-review session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S1</id><text>The joint video-review session began shortly after 18:30, with around twenty players and the two head coaches filing into a rectangular room furnished with three rows of plastic chairs facing a pull-down projection screen.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S2</id><text>The windows of the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room were tilted open to the warm summer air, and a faint echo of ball sounds from the main court nearby could be heard as the players settled into mixed groups rather than sitting strictly by team.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S3</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 connected the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to a ceiling-mounted Trinovar Castline P7 projector in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to display the 2025-07-24 training footage.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S4</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 used a short black HDMI cable to link the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to the Trinovar Castline P7 projector input panel, then dimmed the room lights so the footage appeared as a clear, wall-filling image near the far end of the meeting room.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S5</id><text>On the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder menu, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had already bookmarked four key clips by timestamp, allowing quick jumps between pressing sequences and build-up examples from the 2025-07-24 session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S6</id><text>Before starting the playback, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players that the main aim of the meeting was to refine shared \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d cues from both defensive and build-up perspectives.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S7</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 added that the evening was \u201cnot about blaming anyone on the screen, but about learning what our next decisions should look like,\u201d prompting several players from both squads to nod and shift forward in their seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S8</id><text>A few Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players quietly opened small spiral notebooks on their laps as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 spoke, ready to jot down any cues or passing patterns that might be useful in the August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to watch an early clip where Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 applied a sideline press and to focus on the body angles of the second defender.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S10</id><text>The selected clip from the 2025-07-24 recording showed a Blue-bibbed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arriving slightly square to the touchline on the right side, and coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 replayed the five-second action twice so everyone could see how that angle affected the trap.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S11</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pointed toward the projected image with the cap of his marker and asked the mixed group whether the second defender\u2019s front foot should be pointing more toward the ball or more toward the center, inviting short, one-word answers from the front row.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S12</id><text>During a paused frame of the same sequence, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 used a whiteboard in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to sketch the ideal positions for the first and second defender in the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S13</id><text>On the whiteboard, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 drew a simplified half-court diagram with small crosses for defenders, circles for attackers, and a bold arrow showing the first defender\u2019s pressing run toward the sideline while the second defender staggered half a step behind and slightly inside.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S14</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 wrote \u201c1.5 steps gap\u201d and \u201cbody half-open\u201d beside the second defender\u2019s symbol, explaining that this spacing allowed quick cover if the opponent cut inside or played a bounce pass back toward the middle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S15</id><text>In a later segment of the video, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 highlighted a passage where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 struggled to build out from the back against the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 press and invited Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to suggest alternative passing options.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S16</id><text>The paused scene showed the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper holding the ball with both flank options tightly marked and a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 forward closing in, and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 asked whether a quick diagonal pass to the pivot between the lines or a wall pass off the near defender would have been safer.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S17</id><text>One Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender raised a hand and suggested that a pre-agreed rotation, with the far-side defender stepping into the middle as a third option, could have created a clearer passing lane against the two-player press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S18</id><text>The goalkeepers from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 sat together in the front row while coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 replayed short goal-throw sequences to discuss how the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d cues influenced distribution choices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S19</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall leaned forward with elbows on his knees, occasionally jotting single words such as \u201cquick start\u201d and \u201clook weak side\u201d on a small notepad as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 paused and rewound individual throws.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S20</id><text>On one freeze-frame, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 traced an imaginary passing line across the bottom of the projected image, explaining to both goalkeepers how an early release toward the side opposite the incoming paired press could bypass two defenders before they locked the line.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S21</id><text>Midway through the session, a brief break at the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room allowed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest
