N0-S0 uniquely provides the final day\u2019s calendar date; N0-S4 uniquely provides the relative offset (\u201ctwo weeks earlier\u201d). Both are necessary: N0-S0 supplies the reference event and date; N0-S4 supplies the time gap to the qualifying achievement.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the duration in days between:\n  - the day Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 secured the Grendale Suburban Zone berth, and\n  - the final day of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship at Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center.\n- The solver must:\n  - Recognize from N0-S0 what the reference final day is.\n  - Use N0-S4\u2019s \u201ctwo weeks earlier\u201d relative to that final day.\n  - Convert \u201ctwo weeks\u201d into days.\n\nUnique information needed from each selected sentence:\n- N0-S0:\n  - Identifies the \u201cfinal day of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship at Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center\u201d as a specific calendar day (though the question will avoid giving the date explicitly).\n  - Provides the event that serves as the reference point for \u201cearlier\u201d.\n- N0-S4:\n  - States that the Zone berth was secured \u201ctwo weeks earlier,\u201d thus providing the exact time difference relative to that final day.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Final day date (from N0-S0): 2025-03-22.\n- \u201cTwo weeks earlier\u201d (from N0-S4) = 14 days earlier.\n- Date of securing the Zone berth: 2025-03-22 \u2212 14 days = 2025-03-08.\n- Duration between 2025-03-08 and 2025-03-22:\n  - 14 days.\n\nThus, the time span between securing the Grendale Suburban Zone berth and the final day of the championship is 14 days.\n\n</scratchpad>",
      "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.\n\nMain checks:\n\n1. **Use of selected sentences and temporal reasoning**\n   - The solution correctly used:\n     - N0-S0: to identify the final day of the championship.\n     - N0-S4: to identify that the Zone berth was secured a fixed time before that final day.\n   - The calculation of the time span (14 days) was correct.\n\n2. **Requirement that all selected sentences are necessary and sufficient**\n   - N0-S0 is necessary: it uniquely identifies the specific final day event.\n   - N0-S4 is necessary: it uniquely specifies the temporal relationship between the final day and the securing of the Zone berth.\n   - No other sentences provide this combination of \u201cfinal day\u201d + \u201ctime gap to securing the berth\u201d, so the criteria are satisfied.\n\n3. **Key issue: forbidden temporal information in the question**\n   - The instructions state:\n     - \u201cIn your question, DO NOT include the required temporal information. The temporal information must be inferred from the content of the selected sentences.\u201d\n   - The previous question explicitly said:\n     - \u201c...having secured the Grendale Suburban Zone berth \u2018two weeks earlier\u2019...\u201d\n   - This reproduces the exact relative temporal phrase from N0-S4 in the question itself, which violates the requirement that the temporal information must be inferred from the outline, not restated in the question.\n\n4. **Assumptions requirement**\n   - The instructions also say:\n     - \u201cIf you make assumptions, make sure they are plausible. \u2026 State your assumptions that are required to answer the question clearly in the question.\u201d\n   - The prior question correctly stated assumptions about ignoring time-of-day differences and interpreting \u201ctwo weeks\u201d as exact weeks of seven days, but it did so by explicitly repeating \u201ctwo weeks earlier,\u201d which is not allowed.\n\n5. **Correction approach**\n   - Keep the logical structure and the computed answer (14 days).\n   - Modify the question so that:\n     - It does not explicitly state \u201ctwo weeks earlier\u201d or any numeric temporal span that comes from N0-S4.\n     - It still clearly states the assumptions (week length, ignoring time-of-day) in a generic way, without giving away the specific temporal value from the outline.\n   - A compliant phrasing:\n     - Refer to \u201cthe timing described in the outline\u201d or \u201cthe earlier time mentioned for when they secured the Zone berth\u201d without quoting or specifying the \u201ctwo weeks\u201d phrase.\n     - Example: \u201cAssume that the \u2018earlier\u2019 timing mentioned for securing the Grendale Suburban Zone berth is interpreted as exactly that many calendar days before the final day\u2026\u201d \u2013 this forces the solver to read N0-S4 to see what \u201cthat many\u201d means.\n\n6. **Other criteria**\n   - No explicit calendar dates in the question: already satisfied and kept.\n   - Answer format: a concise time span, not a sentence: \u201c14 days\u201d is correct.\n   - No extra, unnecessary sentences: additional_sentence_ids remains empty.\n\nTherefore, the only required change is to rephrase the question to remove the explicit \u201ctwo weeks earlier\u201d phrase while still stating assumptions in a generic way.\n\n</scratchpad>",
