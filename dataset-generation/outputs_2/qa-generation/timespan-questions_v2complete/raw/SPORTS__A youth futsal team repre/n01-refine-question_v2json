Thus, both N1-S1 and N1-S12 are required.\n   - No other sentence in the outline repeats the \u201crelease\u201d event or date in the same way, so they cannot replace N1-S12.\n\n3. **Avoiding explicit dates in the question**\n   - The question describes the two points in time in terms of:\n     - \u201cthe editor\u2019s requested first-draft submission deadline\u201d\n     - \u201cthe morning when the mid-year print issue that included that analytical series was released\u201d\n   - It does not mention any explicit calendar dates or relative spans; those must be extracted from N1-S1 and N1-S12.

communications officer Lina Veress to write a print feature series on the title run of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S1</id><text>During a planning meeting at the modest Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly office near the eastern tram loop in Selvarin City, editor Ralen Ko outlined a three-part, 10\u201312 page series and asked Lina Veress to submit a first draft by 2025-06-20 to meet the mid-year print deadline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S2</id><text>Editor Ralen Ko specifically cited the composed courtside interview that Lina Veress had conducted with head coach Marlen Tiravo after the final as a key reason for assigning the feature, believing that Lina Veress could balance tactical detail with human-interest storytelling for a youth audience.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S3</id><text>On 2025-06-18, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granted Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly permission to reproduce selected statistics and photographs from the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship in the feature series authored by Lina Veress.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S4</id><text>The permission was confirmed in a two-page email agreement signed off by Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council chairperson Doran Helv, stipulating that all images be credit-lined to the council archive and used only in connection with non-elite youth futsal education.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S5</id><text>Along with the written approval, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council provided Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly with a folder of 24 high-resolution action photographs and the official match-statistics spreadsheets for all five fixtures played by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S6</id><text>In preparation for the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series, Lina Veress conducted extended interviews with head coach Marlen Tiravo of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 focusing on training structure, team culture, and the weeks leading up to the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S7</id><text>The interviews consisted of two evening video calls and one in-person conversation at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy office, each lasting around 70 to 90 minutes, with head coach Marlen Tiravo bringing along a binder of weekly training schedules from January to March 2025.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S8</id><text>During these discussions, head coach Marlen Tiravo described specific routines such as Monday small-sided pressing games and Thursday match-simulation blocks, and emphasized to Lina Veress how player-led feedback circles on Fridays had helped shape the squad\u2019s sense of collective responsibility.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S9</id><text>Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly staff used match footage from Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center to create tactical diagrams and sequence illustrations that visually supported the written analysis by Lina Veress of the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 performances.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S10</id><text>The magazine\u2019s two-person analysis team replayed key passages from the semifinal and final on a large screen in their editing room, manually logging pressing triggers, passing lanes, and player rotations that could be translated into simplified diagrams for young readers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S11</id><text>Graphic designer Hele Narm transformed these notes into four full-page diagrams and several smaller in-text sequences, using colored arrows and numbered frames to show how Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 shifted from a compact 2\u20132 block into coordinated counter-attacks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S12</id><text>On the morning of 2025-06-30, Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly released its mid-year print issue featuring a multi-part analytical series by Lina Veress on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 campaign at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S13</id><text>The issue, Volume 13 Number 2, had a print run of approximately 2,500 copies and was distributed to secondary schools, community sports halls, and neighborhood kiosks across Selvarin City and the Grendale Suburban Zone at a cover price of 8 selvars.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S14</id><text>The front cover of the mid-year issue featured a full-width photograph of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 captain Mikel Ardan lifting the championship trophy, with a headline banner reading \u201cHow Grendale Built a Champion Team.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S15</id><text>Within the 2025-06-30 issue of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly, an article titled \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress detailed a recurring defensive pattern used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship and translated it into step-by-step drills for youth coaches.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S16</id><text>The \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d piece filled four magazine pages and broke the concept into three progressive training blocks, each specifying recommended pitch dimensions, work-to-rest ratios, and suggested adaptations for under-13, under-15, and under-17 age groups.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S17</id><text>A highlighted sidebar within the article quoted head coach Marlen Tiravo explaining how a simple verbal cue of \u201cstep and cover\u201d helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players coordinate their movements when initiating the paired press in competitive matches.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S18</id><text>On the afternoon of 2025-06-30, head coach Marlen Tiravo held a classroom-style review session at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy training facility where Marlen Tiravo distributed copies of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series by Lina Veress to the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S19</id><text>The review session took place in a small upstairs meeting room overlooking the indoor training court, with around a dozen players seated at desks while head coach Marlen Tiravo used a whiteboard and a projector to walk through key diagrams from the magazine.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo asked each player of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to highlight at least one paragraph that reflected their own habits, leading to a brief discussion in which several players expressed surprise at seeing their off-the-ball work described in print.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S21</id><text>By the evening of 2025-06-30, several school futsal coaches in Selvarin City, including Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach Harven Soll, reported using the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly articles by Lina Veress as practical reference material for planning upcoming youth training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S22</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 marked specific drills from \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d with sticky notes in his planning notebook and penciled them into his July pre-season schedule as alternatives to his standard defensive warm-up routines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S23</id><text>Other coaches in Selvarin City mentioned in informal messages to editor Ralen Ko that they appreciated the clear field diagrams and ready-made session plans, which allowed them to adapt Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 concepts without having to design exercises from scratch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S24</id><text>In a brief comment published alongside the feature series on 2025-06-30, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council development coordinator Neris Dalvo stated that Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council did not plan to produce separate official school case-study booklets about the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 title run.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S25</id><text>The note from development coordinator Neris Dalvo appeared in a shaded \u201cCouncil Perspective\u201d box at the bottom of the first feature page, where Neris Dalvo cited limited staff capacity and a preference for issuing broader coaching guidelines rather than detailed profiles of single teams.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S26</id><text>In the same comment, development coordinator Neris Dalvo nevertheless thanked Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 for setting \u201ca positive standard for preparation and sportsmanship\u201d and expressed support for independent publications that highlighted constructive youth coaching practices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S27</id><text>Despite the absence of dedicated case-study materials from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, local coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone and broader Selvarin City began informally treating the series by Lina Veress in Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly as a de facto reference document for youth futsal training discussions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S28</id><text>During informal planning conversations and email exchanges on 2025-06-30, several coaches referred to specific pages of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly issue\u2014such as the transition-attack diagram on page 11\u2014as shorthand examples when debating how aggressively to press with teenage players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S29</id><text>Some coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone scanned or photographed selected layouts from the feature series and shared them within small staff groups, using the material as a common visual basis for adjusting their own session content rather than as any kind of official curriculum.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>",

No specific time of day is needed because we will measure the duration in whole days.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Permission granted: 2025-06-18 (whole day).\n\n[Sentence ID]: N1-S12\n- Time information:\n  - Explicit absolute date phrase: \u201cOn the morning of 2025-06-30\u201d.\n  - Describes Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly releasing its mid-year print issue featuring the multi-part analytical series by Lina Veress.\n- Event date:\n  - The event container date is also 2025-06-30, which matches this explicit date, so there is no conflict.\nAssumptions:\n- The release occurs in the morning of 2025-06-30; since no time is given for 2025-06-18, and we will count in days, the \u201cmorning\u201d detail does not affect the count of full days between the two calendar dates.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Issue released: 2025-06-30 (morning of that calendar day).\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- No additional sentences are needed. N1-S3 uniquely provides the date of granting permission; N1-S12 uniquely provides the date of the mid-year issue release. No other sentence in the outline provides either of these specific dates, so neither selected sentence can be replaced.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the number of days between:\n  - The day when the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granted Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly permission to reproduce statistics and photographs from the championship (from N1-S3), and\n  - The morning when Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly released its mid-year print issue featuring the analytical series on Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17\u2019s campaign (from N1-S12).\n- This requires:\n  - From N1-S3: identifying the exact calendar date of the permission.\n  - From N1-S12: identifying the exact calendar date of the release.\n  - Then computing the elapsed time between those two calendar dates.\n- To satisfy the constraints:\n  - The question will not explicitly mention any calendar dates; instead, it will describe the two events in words.\n  - You cannot answer the question if you only know the release date or only know the permission date; both are required.\n  - No other sentence in the full outline provides both endpoints or can substitute for either N1-S3 or N1-S12.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start date: Permission granted on 2025-06-18 (from N1-S3).\n- End date: Issue released on the morning of 2025-06-30 (from N1-S12).\n- Duration in days:\n  - June has 30 days.\n  - From 18 June to 30 June:\n    - 18 \u2192 19: 1 day\n    - 19 \u2192 20: 1 day (2 total)\n    - 20 \u2192 21: 1 day (3 total)\n    - 21 \u2192 22: 1 day (4 total)\n    - 22 \u2192 23: 1 day (5 total)\n    - 23 \u2192 24: 1 day (6 total)\n    - 24 \u2192 25: 1 day (7 total)\n    - 25 \u2192 26: 1 day (8 total)\n    - 26 \u2192 27: 1 day (9 total)\n    - 27 \u2192 28: 1 day (10 total)\n    - 28 \u2192 29: 1 day (11 total)\n    - 29 \u2192 30: 1 day (12 total)\n- Therefore, the elapsed time between the permission being granted and the mid-year issue being released is 12 days.\n\n</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the original response against the task instructions:\n\n1. **Use of selected sentences & temporal info**\n   - N1-S3 provides the date when the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granted permission.\n   - N1-S12 provides the date when the mid-year print issue was released.\n   - The question clearly refers to:\n     - \u201cthe day when the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granted \u2026 permission\u201d (N1-S3),\n     - \u201cthe morning when Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly released its mid-year print issue featuring the multi-part analytical series \u2026\u201d (N1-S12).\n   - Both are required to determine the two endpoints, and no other sentence duplicates these specific events and dates. Thus, all selected sentences are needed and sufficient.\n\n2. **Time span and reasoning**\n   - The duration is computed as the number of days between 2025-06-18 and 2025-06-30:\n     - From 18 \u2192 30 June is 12 days (counting day differences, not inclusive).\n   - The answer is expressed as an absolute duration in days.\n   - No absolute dates appear in the question text; the user must infer the dates from the sentences then compute the span.\n\n3. **Constraints from instructions**\n   - The question asks about a duration between two points in time, not about a single date.\n   - All selected sentences are necessary to answer it; without either N1-S3 or N1-S12, one endpoint is missing.\n   - No other sentence in the outline can replace these for this specific pair of events (permission grant vs. mid-year issue release).\n   - No other event or date from the outline alone is sufficient to answer the question.\n   - The answer is given only as \u201c12 days,\u201d not a full sentence, which aligns with the instruction.\n\n4. **Possible issues / adjustments**\n   - The only subtle mismatch is with the structure of `<additional_sentence_ids>`. Originally, I left it empty because no *extra* sentences beyond the provided selected ones were required.\n   - The user\u2019s latest instruction now says: \u201cList of additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected in the previous response), if applicable.\u201d This suggests that in this revised response, I should list the sentence IDs actually used (N1-S3 and N1-S12), even if they are not \u201cadditional\u201d beyond the originally selected pair.\n   - The question and the computed answer themselves are correct and already follow the temporal reasoning instructions, so no change is needed there.\n\n5. **Corrections**\n   - I will keep the question and answer unchanged.\n   - I will update `<additional_sentence_ids>` so it explicitly lists the two sentence IDs used (N1-S3, N1-S12).\n   - I will add a brief explanation in `<additional_sentence_explanation>` describing the unique role of each of these sentences.\n\nNo other corrections are necessary.\n\n</scratchpad>",
