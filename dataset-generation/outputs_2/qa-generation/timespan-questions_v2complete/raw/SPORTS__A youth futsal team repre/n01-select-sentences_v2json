Sentences mentioning relative time differences (e.g., \"six weeks ago\", \"in five days\", \"after two hours\"). Try to determine the specific date or time they refer to based on the context.\n2. Sentences mentioning a specific date or time (e.g., \"10:00 am\", \"March 22nd\").\n3. Sentences containing specific details unique to the current event.\n\nYour task is to select tuples of NUM_SENTENCES sentences from which you can derive two specific points in time and compute a meaningful time span (duration). Follow these guidelines:\n- The duration should be computed between comparable units.\n- It must be possible to compute a specific time span between the two points in time.\n- Prioritize sentences containing relative time differences for which you can compute a specific point in time.\n- If possible, include sentences that mention a specific point in time explicitly.\n- If neither of the above is possible, you may select sentences that rely only on the date of the events. However, it is preferred to collect sentences that introduce novel time information.\n\nIf multiple events are provided, the sentences must come from different events. If only one event is provided, the sentences can come from the same event.\nRemember: It should be possible to compute a duration based on different specific points in time from the different selected sentence. DO NOT collect sentences based on which you can compare the ratio of different explicitly mentioned durations! Only select sentences based on which you can compute a meaningful absolute duration.\n\nUse a <scratchpad> to plan your approach before outputting your final results. In your scratchpad, you can list potential sentence pairs, evaluate their suitability, and determine which ones to include in your final output.\n\nFor each tuple you identify, output the result in the following format:\n\n<time-span>\n<ids>[IDs of the selected sentences (comma separated)]</ids>\n<explanation>[Explanation of how the time span can be computed from these sentences]</explanation>\n</time-span>\n\nWrap all your results, including the scratchpad and time spans, in a <result> root node.\n\nExample:\n<result>\n<scratchpad>\nPotential pairs:\n1. Sentences 2 and 5: Mention specific dates, can calculate exact duration.\n2. Sentences 1 and 7: Relative time reference and specific time, need to infer exact start point.\n3.
