student volunteer beside the court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S2</id><text>Around 35 spectators, mainly classmates, a few parents, and two teachers from the Meadowlane Quarter of Selvarin City,

on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll gathered the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a short meeting to explain that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 would apply ideas from the article Pressing in Pairs by Lina Veress during the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S4</id><text>The pre-match meeting for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 took place in a narrow changing room beside the indoor court, where coach Harven Soll held up a printed copy of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly opened to the Pressing in Pairs diagrams and pointed out the roles of the first and second defender to the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll emphasized to Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that the goal of the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 was to communicate clearly and stay compact in the press, telling the squad that \u201cthe result matters less today than whether we move together in twos.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S6</id><text>During the pre-match warm-up on 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 ran their first on-court version of a paired pressing shadow drill adapted from Pressing in Pairs under the direct supervision of coach Harven Soll.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S7</id><text>In the paired pressing shadow drill, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players worked in twos along the halfway line, sliding sideways in unison to close imaginary passing lanes while coach Harven Soll shouted cues such as \u201cstep and cover\u201d and \u201cshow outside\u201d from just inside the center circle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S8</id><text>The overall warm-up for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 lasted about 18 minutes and combined the new shadow pressing movements with a brief four-versus-one rondo and a short shooting sequence before Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began its own preparations on the opposite half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S9</id><text>In the opening half of the 2025-07-12 friendly, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 kept the score 0\u20130 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 repeatedly used two-player presses to force the ball toward the sidelines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S10</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 set up in a 2\u20132 defensive shape for most of the first half and repeatedly angled pressure toward the left sideline, funneling Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into rushed passes that rolled harmlessly over the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S11</id><text>Although the score remained 0\u20130 before halftime, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 managed three shots on target compared with one clear chance for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, whose close-range effort was beaten away at the near post by the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S12</id><text>Early in the second half on 2025-07-12, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger finished a fast counterattack from the right side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S13</id><text>The opening goal for Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived roughly three minutes after the restart when a misplaced square pass by a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender near the attacking third was intercepted and quickly relayed into a three-pass counter down the right flank.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S14</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger cut inside toward the edge of the area and drove a firm low shot across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall into the far corner, putting Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 ahead 1\u20130.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S15</id><text>Midway through the second half on 2025-07-12, wide player Talen Priev equalized for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to make the score 1\u20131 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 with a low left-footed shot after intercepting a pass near halfway.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S16</id><text>The goal by wide player Talen Priev came around the ninth minute of the second half when Talen Priev stepped into a lateral pass near the center circle as Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sprung a coordinated press from the left side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S17</id><text>After carrying the ball roughly ten meters under pressure from a retreating Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender, Talen Priev opened his body and slid a left-footed finish inside the near post, drawing loud applause from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 supporters on the bleachers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S18</id><text>Throughout the second half on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll noted from the bench that the back line of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 shifted laterally and covered central space more consistently when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 activated paired presses inspired by Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S19</id><text>From his seat on the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 bench, coach Harven Soll periodically scribbled arrows and short comments on a clipboard, marking how the two central defenders tucked in behind the ball whenever Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pushed a first presser toward the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S20</id><text>Several times as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 tried to build through the middle, coach Harven Soll pointed toward the top of the penalty area and shouted reminders such as \u201cprotect the middle\u201d and \u201cclose the gap,\u201d prompting the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 back line to narrow their spacing compared with earlier in the season.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S21</id><text>After the final whistle of the 1\u20131 draw on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll told the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a brief huddle that the Pressing in Pairs-oriented work had improved the defensive shape of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 still needed to react faster to long diagonal passes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S22</id><text>The post-match huddle for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 formed near the center circle, with the players standing in a tight semicircle around coach Harven Soll, sweat-soaked bibs pulled over their school jerseys as they listened quietly to the feedback.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S23</id><text>Coach Harven Soll singled out one late Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attack that had exposed the far-post area, telling Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that upcoming sessions would focus on getting the weak-side defender to drop earlier whenever the opponent shaped to play a diagonal switch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S24</id><text>Following the post-match team talk on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll and visiting coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed at courtside that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 would arrange a second friendly later in July to further test the new pressing structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S25</id><text>While players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 shook hands and gathered scattered balls, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos stood near the halfway line comparing open dates in the last two weeks of July in their pocket notebooks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S26</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos remarked to coach Harven Soll that the adjusted pressing of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had forced Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into more long passes than usual, and both coaches discussed the possibility of recording short video clips of the next friendly for a joint post-game review.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S27</id><text>Later in the evening of 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll updated the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to schedule Pressing in Pairs-based defensive blocks twice a week in the remaining July sessions for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 before the school league begins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S28</id><text>At a kitchen table in the Meadowlane Quarter that evening, coach Harven Soll spread out the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 match sheet and his color-coded training planner, penciling in 20-minute Pressing in Pairs segments on Tuesday and Thursday slots for the rest of July.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S29</id><text>In the margin of the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll wrote a reminder to pair the defensive blocks with short transition games focusing on reacting to diagonal passes and covering the back post as preparation for the upcoming school league fixtures.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>",

detailed a recurring defensive pattern used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship and translated it into step-by-step drills for youth coaches.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S16</id><text>The \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d piece filled four magazine pages and broke the concept into three progressive training blocks, each specifying recommended pitch dimensions, work-to-rest ratios, and suggested adaptations for under-13, under-15, and under-17 age groups.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S17</id><text>A highlighted sidebar within the

player of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to highlight at least one paragraph that reflected their own habits, leading to a brief discussion in which several players expressed surprise at seeing their off-the-ball work described in print.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S21</id><text>By the evening of 2025-06-30, several school futsal coaches in Selvarin City, including Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach Harven Soll, reported using the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly articles by Lina Veress as practical reference material for planning upcoming youth training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S22</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 marked specific drills from \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d with sticky notes in his planning notebook and penciled them into his July pre-season schedule as alternatives to his standard defensive warm-up routines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S23</id><text>Other coaches in Selvarin City mentioned in informal messages to editor Ralen Ko that they appreciated the clear field diagrams and ready-made session plans, which allowed them to adapt Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 concepts without having to design exercises from scratch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S24</id><text>In a brief comment published alongside the feature series on 2025-06-30, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council development coordinator Neris Dalvo stated that Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council did not plan to produce separate official school case-study booklets about the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 title run.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S25</id><text>The note from development coordinator Neris Dalvo appeared in a shaded \u201cCouncil Perspective\u201d box at the bottom of the first feature page, where Neris Dalvo cited limited staff capacity and a preference for issuing broader coaching guidelines rather than detailed profiles of single teams.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S26</id><text>In the same comment, development coordinator Neris Dalvo nevertheless thanked Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 for setting \u201ca positive standard for preparation and sportsmanship\u201d and expressed support for independent publications that highlighted constructive youth coaching practices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S27</id><text>Despite the absence of dedicated case-study materials from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, local coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone and broader Selvarin City began informally treating the series by Lina Veress in Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly as a de facto reference document for youth futsal training discussions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S28</id><text>During informal planning conversations and email exchanges on 2025-06-30, several coaches referred to specific pages of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly issue\u2014such as the transition-attack diagram on page 11\u2014as shorthand examples when debating how aggressively to press with teenage players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N1-S29</id><text>Some coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone scanned or photographed selected layouts from the feature series and shared them within small staff groups, using the material as a common visual basis for adjusting their own session content rather than as any kind of official curriculum.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-03</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N2-S0</id><text>On 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo led a 90-minute low-pressure afternoon

and newly appointed fitness coach Kelran Dov arranged the new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment along one side of the indoor court of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy for use by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S4</id><text>The equipment layout prepared by head coach Marlen Tiravo and fitness coach Kelran Dov on 2025-07-03 included a neat row of twelve white-and-blue size-4 futsal balls, two collapsible 2-by-3-meter portable goals, two flat agility ladders, and eight low yellow mini-hurdles positioned just inside the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S5</id><text>Fitness coach Kelran Dov, who had formally joined the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 staff at the start of July after previously assisting with younger age groups at the academy, took several minutes to check ball inflation with a handheld pressure gauge before the players stepped onto the court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S6</id><text>The futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03 had been purchased earlier in the week by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy with part of the development grant previously awarded by Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S7</id><text>According to staff at Grendale Youth Futsal Academy, the order for the new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility equipment had been placed with a Selvarin City sports supplier on 2025-06-30 and delivered to the Grendale Suburban Zone facility on the afternoon of 2025-07-02.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S8</id><text>Around two-thirds of the 3,000-selvars development grant from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council was allocated to the equipment package used on 2025-07-03, with the remaining funds at Grendale Youth Futsal Academy earmarked for future replacement items and basic maintenance costs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S9</id><text>At the beginning of the 2025-07-03 session, the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 completed a gentle dynamic warm-up of jogging, joint-mobility work, and short accelerations under the supervision of head coach Marlen Tiravo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S10</id><text>The initial warm-up block for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 on 2025-07-03 lasted roughly 12 minutes and took place in two staggered lines running the length of the court, with exercises such as hip-openers, arm swings, and side shuffles interspersed between light jogs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S11</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo walked slowly along the sideline during the warm-up on 2025-07-03, occasionally stopping a player to adjust posture or stride length and reminding the group that the day\u2019s focus was on \u201cwaking the body up, not testing limits.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S12</id><text>Following the warm-up on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo organized Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 into small groups for individual ball-control stations that emphasized toe-touches, rolls, and turns using the new futsal balls supplied by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S13</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo divided the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players into three groups spread across half the court, rotating them every three minutes between stations that focused on fast toe-taps, sole rolls over five-meter lanes, and tight 180-degree turns around cones.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S14</id><text>During the ball-control segment on 2025-07-03, captain Mikel Ardan and flank player Sera Noll were asked by head coach Marlen Tiravo to demonstrate a sequence of inside-outside touches at one station before the rest of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 repeated the pattern at a slower tempo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S15</id><text>During the middle phase of the 2025-07-03 practice, fitness coach Kelran Dov led Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 through low-intensity agility patterns over the new ladders and mini-hurdles to reintroduce movement mechanics without imposing heavy physical load.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S16</id><text>The agility phase run by fitness coach Kelran Dov on 2025-07-03 featured simple in-in-out foot patterns through the ladders, lateral shuffles, and single-step hops over the mini-hurdles, with each repetition kept to 10\u201312 seconds followed by at least 30 seconds of rest.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S17</id><text>Fitness coach Kelran Dov carried a clipboard during the agility work for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17, jotting brief notes on knee alignment and upper-body control while offering verbal cues such as \u201csoft landings\u201d and \u201ceyes forward\u201d after each short set.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S18</id><text>In the final third of the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo set up the portable goals so that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 could perform relaxed finishing exercises with minimal defensive pressure and an emphasis on clean technique.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S19</id><text>For the finishing drills on 2025-07-03, the two portable goals were placed about nine meters from the end lines on opposite sides of the court, and Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players worked in pairs combining a wall pass and a controlled first touch before shooting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo encouraged the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players to alternate between dominant and weaker feet during the finishing segment and frequently stopped sequences to praise composed body shape or a well-placed low shot into the corners.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S21</id><text>At a brief pause before the last exercise block on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo told the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 that pressing drills and transition games would be deliberately postponed until the following week so that the team could first adjust to the new equipment.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S22</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the squad gathered around, head coach Marlen Tiravo explained that he wanted Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to \u201clearn exactly how these balls move on the floor before we ask you to sprint and press again,\u201d prompting several players to nod in agreement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S23</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also reminded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the pause that the concepts from the recent \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d article would still be part of the upcoming training cycle, but that 2025-07-03 was intended as a technical reset rather than an intense tactical session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S24</id><text>Toward the end of the 2025-07-03 training, goalkeeper Ren Talvek completed a short series of catching and distribution routines with the new futsal balls under the guidance of head coach Marlen Tiravo to assess the bounce and grip for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S25</id><text>Goalkeeper Ren Talvek\u2019s short block of work on 2025-07-03 included sets of low driven shots along the floor, high looping balls dropped from head coach Marlen Tiravo\u2019s hands, and side-arm throws toward marked zones near the touchline to test both handling and passing range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S26</id><text>After one sequence in which a shot skimmed off his gloves, goalkeeper Ren Talvek commented to head coach Marlen Tiravo that the new futsal balls felt \u201ca touch livelier off the surface\u201d than the previous batch, and the pair briefly discussed adjusting his stance for low saves.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S27</id><text>After the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo sent a brief email from the office of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy to development coordinator Neris Dalvo at Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council to report that Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 had begun using the funded equipment and to thank Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council for the support.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S28</id><text>The email from head coach Marlen Tiravo to development coordinator Neris Dalvo was sent shortly after 17:15 on 2025-07-03 under the subject line \u201cEquipment grant update \u2013 Grendale U17\u201d and included two attached photographs of the new futsal balls and agility layout on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy indoor court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S29</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also copied the academy director on the 2025-07-03 message to Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, noting in one paragraph that the lighter session had helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 return from a short post-championship break without overloading the players.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-12</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N3-S0</id><text>On 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 hosted Varlen Crest Futsal Club

Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 student volunteer beside the court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S2</id><text>Around 35 spectators, mainly classmates, a few parents, and two teachers from the Meadowlane Quarter of Selvarin City, watched from the single row of retractable bleachers that runs along one touchline of the indoor court of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S3</id><text>Before the warm-up on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll gathered the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a short meeting to explain that

Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S4</id><text>The pre-match meeting for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 took place in a narrow changing room beside the indoor court, where coach Harven Soll held up a printed copy of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly opened to the Pressing in Pairs diagrams and pointed out the roles of the first and second defender to the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll emphasized to Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that the goal of the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 was to communicate clearly and stay compact in the press, telling the squad that \u201cthe result matters less today than whether we move together in twos.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S6</id><text>During the pre-match warm-up on 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 ran their first on-court version of a paired pressing shadow drill adapted from Pressing in Pairs under the direct supervision of coach Harven Soll.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S7</id><text>In the paired pressing shadow drill, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players worked in twos along the halfway line, sliding sideways in unison to close imaginary passing lanes while coach Harven Soll shouted cues such as \u201cstep and cover\u201d and \u201cshow outside\u201d from just inside the center circle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S8</id><text>The overall warm-up for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 lasted about 18 minutes and combined the new shadow pressing movements with a brief four-versus-one rondo and a short shooting sequence before Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began its own preparations on the opposite half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S9</id><text>In the opening half of the 2025-07-12 friendly, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 kept the score 0\u20130 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 repeatedly used two-player presses to force the ball toward the sidelines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S10</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 set up in a 2\u20132 defensive shape for most of the first half and repeatedly angled pressure toward the left sideline, funneling Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into rushed passes that rolled harmlessly over the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S11</id><text>Although the score remained 0\u20130 before halftime, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 managed three shots on target compared with one clear chance for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, whose close-range effort was beaten away at the near post by the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S12</id><text>Early in the second half on 2025-07-12, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger finished a fast counterattack from the right side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S13</id><text>The opening goal for Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived roughly three minutes after the restart when a misplaced square pass by a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender near the attacking third was intercepted and quickly relayed into a three-pass counter down the right flank.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S14</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger cut inside toward the edge of the area and drove a firm low shot across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall into the far corner, putting Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 ahead 1\u20130.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S15</id><text>Midway through the second half on 2025-07-12, wide player Talen Priev equalized for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to make the score 1\u20131 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 with a low left-footed shot after intercepting a pass near halfway.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S16</id><text>The goal by wide player Talen Priev came around the ninth minute of the second half when Talen Priev stepped into a lateral pass near the center circle as Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sprung a coordinated press from the left side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S17</id><text>After carrying the ball roughly ten meters under pressure from a retreating Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender, Talen Priev opened his body and slid a left-footed finish inside the near post, drawing loud applause from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 supporters on the bleachers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S18</id><text>Throughout the second half on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll noted from the bench that the back line of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 shifted laterally and covered central space more consistently when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 activated paired presses inspired by Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S19</id><text>From his seat on the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 bench, coach Harven Soll periodically scribbled arrows and short comments on a clipboard, marking how the two central defenders tucked in behind the ball whenever Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pushed a first presser toward the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S20</id><text>Several times as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 tried to build through the middle, coach Harven Soll pointed toward the top of the penalty area and shouted reminders such as \u201cprotect the middle\u201d and \u201cclose the gap,\u201d prompting the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 back line to narrow their spacing compared with earlier in the season.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S21</id><text>After the final whistle of the 1\u20131 draw on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll told the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a brief huddle that the Pressing in Pairs-oriented work had improved the defensive shape of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 still needed to react faster to long diagonal passes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S22</id><text>The post-match huddle for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 formed near the center circle, with the players standing in a tight semicircle around coach Harven Soll, sweat-soaked bibs pulled over their school jerseys as they listened quietly to the feedback.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S23</id><text>Coach Harven Soll singled out one late Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attack that had exposed the far-post area, telling Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that upcoming sessions would focus on getting the weak-side defender to drop earlier whenever the opponent shaped to play a diagonal switch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S24</id><text>Following the post-match team talk on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll and visiting coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed at courtside that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 would arrange a second friendly later in July to further test the new pressing structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S25</id><text>While players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 shook hands and gathered scattered balls, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos stood near the halfway line comparing open dates in the last two weeks of July in their pocket notebooks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S26</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos remarked to coach Harven Soll that the adjusted pressing of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had forced Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into more long passes than usual, and both coaches discussed the possibility of recording short video clips of the next friendly for a joint post-game review.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S27</id><text>Later in the evening of 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll updated the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to schedule Pressing in Pairs-based defensive blocks twice a week in the remaining July sessions for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 before the school league begins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S28</id><text>At a kitchen table in the Meadowlane Quarter that evening, coach Harven Soll spread out the Meadowlane School

July.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S29</id><text>In the margin of the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll wrote a reminder to pair the defensive blocks with short

The outline clearly puts Varlen\u2019s goal roughly 3 minutes after the restart and Talen\u2019s around the 9th minute, so the elapsed time between them is 6 minutes, not 9.",

          "question": "In the pre-season friendly between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, focus only on the second half. One goal for Varlen came when a Meadowlane defender\u2019s misplaced square pass near the attacking third was intercepted and turned into a counterattack that produced the opening goal of the half. Later in the same half, wide player Talen Priev scored for Meadowlane after stepping into a lateral pass near the center circle during a coordinated press. If you treat the described \u201croughly\u201d and \u201caround\u201d timings as exact (i.e., the first of these goals happened exactly when stated after the restart, and Talen Priev\u2019s goal happened exactly in the stated minute of the half), how many minutes of second-half play elapsed between these two goals?",
