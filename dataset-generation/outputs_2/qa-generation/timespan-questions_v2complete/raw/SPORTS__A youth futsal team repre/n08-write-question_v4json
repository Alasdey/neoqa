  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a complex question-answer pair based on a fictional event outline. Your goal is to create a question that asks about an absolute time span (duration) that can be computed using specific selected sentences from the outline.\n\nFirst, review the complete storyline outline:\n\n<complete_outline>\n{{STORYLINE_OUTLINE_TO_DATE}}\n</complete_outline>\n\nNow, focus on the selected sentences:\n\n<selected_sentences>\n{{SELECTED_SENTENCES}}\n</selected_sentences>\n\nTo create a time-span question based on the selected sentences, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the absolute date or time within each of the selected sentences if possible. If a sentence doesn't provide additional time information, use the event date as time information. Remember that the dates of individual sub-events within each event may differ from the event date. To compute the specific points in time, check if the selected sentences specify any of the following:\n   - Relative time information (e.g., \"six weeks ago\", \"in five days\", \"after two hours\") based on which you can compute a specific point in time\n   - Absolute time information (e.g., \"10:00 am\", \"March 22nd\")\n   - You can always assume that the date listed for each event is known. The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. \n   - If the specific points in time cannot be asserted with certainty but only estimated based on some likelihood, specify assumptions under which you can derive absolute points in time\n   - If the sentences describe durations, list the respective start and end dates/times together with the assumptions\n\n2. Think about the different options of absolute points of time and which time span between them would be most challenging to compute, ensuring that all selected sentences are required to compute the duration.\n\n3. Draft a specific question that asks for the time duration. This question can only be solved if one derives the absolute points in time from each of the selected sentences. The question must always ask about the duration between two points in time. Prefer time durations that differ from the absolute durations of the respective event (if multiple options of different possible ways to compute durations exist).\n\n4. Formulate a precise and correct answer to the question, which must be an absolute duration. Only use the information from the selected sentences and make the question very specific to avoid ambiguities. In the scratchpad, include a derivation of the answer using the absolute dates you estimated before.\n\n5. Ensure the validity of the questions:\n   - Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present.\n   - Make sure that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n   - Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to answer the question and that no other sentence from the <complete_outline> can replace any of the selected sentence in answering the question.\n   - Adjust the question accordingly to fulfill these criteria by making it more specific.\n\n6. Avoid absolute dates or times in your question if possible:\n   - If you needed to make an assumption about when something happened, try to explain it relative to other existing events or information from the <complete_outline>. Try to replace explicitly mentioned dates by anchoring them into some content of the <complete_outline> instead. If necessary, add the additional required sentence ID to your result and explain the unique information of this sentence that is necessary.\n   - Make sure that temporal reasoning is still required in the revised question. Double-check if the temporal information is still essential to answer the question after resolving the absolute dates. Think about different options (like start and end dates) to make sure that one must apply temporal reasoning to answer the question.\n\n7. If you must integrate additional information beyond what is specified within the selected sentences:\n   - Identify the unique information you must add to the question within the provided <complete_outline> and select the sentence communicating this unique information\n   - Explain what kind of unique information from this sentence is needed and why\n   - List the sentence ID of the newly selected sentence in your result\n   - Rewrite your question accordingly and ensure that all points listed in step 5 are valid when adding the newly selected sentence\n\nProvide your reasoning in the following format:\n<scratchpad>\n(Repeat for all sentence IDs)\n[Sentence ID]:\n- [Describe the time information from this sentence]\n- [Identify the event date]\nAssumptions:\n- [Make your assumptions explicit]\nAbsolute dates:\n- [List all relevant absolute dates from this sentence. Justify how they relate to the event date or other date information.]\n\n\nAdditional sentences:\n[Think about additional sentence IDs to add and explain your decision and what information from the sentence you require. List any new absolute dates based on this information.]\n\nQuestion Idea:\n[Outline how to create a challenging time-span question based on the absolute dates and selected information]\n- [For each selected sentence, specifically elaborate the unique information from this sentence that is required to answer the question. Think about how to frame the question without explicitly stating this unique information.]\n\n[Answer derivation]:\nCompute the answer using the absolute dates from above.\n\n<scratchpad>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<qa>\n<question>[Your generated question about the time span]</question>\n<answer>[The precise and concise answer to the question]</answer>\n<additional_sentence_ids>[List of additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, if applicable]</additional_sentence_ids>\n<additional_sentence_explanation>[Explain the unique information of each additional sentence that is required to answer the question and justify why it is needed, if applicable]</additional_sentence_explanation>\n</qa>\n</results>\n\nRemember to make your question as specific as possible, ensuring that it can only be answered using the information from the selected sentences (and any additional sentences you may need to include). If you need to make assumptions, state them clearly in the question. Always provide a precise and concise answer to the question you generate.\n\nImportant reminders:\n- While each event provides a unique date, which can be helpful to identify the question, the provided date does not necessarily apply to all information listed in the event outline (or the selected sentences extracted from the event outline). The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. Think carefully about how the event date applies to the selected sentences before you start drafting your question. Some events may have happened in the past even though they are not described in the past tense. Use your common sense and the sequence of sentences within the event. If you are reasonably uncertain, make your assumption explicit and include it in your question.\n- Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present, and that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n- Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to infer the correct answer.\n- If you need to include additional sentences, clearly explain why they are necessary and what unique information they provide.\n- In your question clearly indicate if some point in time happens in the future as such (for example when including the planned end date of an ongoing or planned event).\n- In your question, DO NOT include the required temporal information. The temporal information must be inferred from the content of the selected sentences.\n- DO NOT create questions about time-spans that mix units that cannot be compared in a meaningful way (such as minutes and days, days and years).\n- If you make assumptions, make sure they are plausible.\n- If you rely on the event date, carefully assess if the whether the information likely occurred before or after the event date.\n- State your assumptions that are required to answer the question clearly in the question.\n- Make sure that the question cannot be answered without considering unique content from ALL selected evidence sentences (from <selected_sentences> and <additional_sentence_ids>)\n- Explicitly compute and list all dates, including start and end dates, based on your assumptions before you draft your question.\n- The answer should only consist of the correct time span and should not be a complete sentence.\n- Ensure that you DO NOT explicitly refer to absolute dates or relative time spans (from the selected sentences) in the question. It is important that answering the question requires extracting this information from these sentences.",

an emphasis on clean technique.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S19</id><text>For the finishing drills on 2025-07-03, the two portable goals were placed about nine meters from the end lines on opposite sides of the court, and Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players worked in pairs combining a wall pass and a controlled first touch before shooting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo encouraged the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players to alternate between dominant and weaker feet during the finishing segment and frequently stopped sequences to praise composed body shape or a well-placed low shot into the corners.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S21</id><text>At a brief pause before the last exercise block on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo told the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 that pressing drills and transition games would be deliberately postponed until the

players to nod in agreement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S23</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also reminded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the pause that the concepts from the recent \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d article would still be part of the upcoming training cycle, but that 2025-07-03 was intended as a technical reset rather than an intense tactical session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S24</id><text>Toward the end of the 2025-07-03 training, goalkeeper Ren Talvek completed a short series of catching and distribution routines with the new futsal balls under the guidance of head coach Marlen Tiravo to assess the bounce and grip for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S25</id><text>Goalkeeper Ren Talvek\u2019s short block of work on 2025-07-03 included sets of low driven shots along the floor, high looping balls dropped from head coach Marlen Tiravo\u2019s hands, and side-arm throws toward marked zones near the touchline to test both handling and passing range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S26</id><text>After one sequence in which a shot skimmed off his gloves, goalkeeper Ren Talvek commented to head coach Marlen Tiravo that the new futsal balls felt \u201ca touch livelier off the surface\u201d than the previous batch, and the pair briefly discussed adjusting his stance for low saves.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S27</id><text>After the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo sent a brief email from the office of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy to development coordinator

support.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S28</id><text>The email from head coach Marlen Tiravo to development coordinator Neris Dalvo was sent shortly after 17:15 on 2025-07-03 under the subject line

players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll emphasized to Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that the goal of the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 was to

twos.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S6</id><text>During the pre-match warm-up on 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 ran their first on-court version of a paired pressing shadow drill adapted from Pressing in Pairs under the direct supervision of coach Harven Soll.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S7</id><text>In the paired pressing shadow drill, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players worked in twos along the halfway line, sliding sideways in unison to close imaginary passing lanes while coach Harven Soll shouted cues such as \u201cstep and cover\u201d and \u201cshow outside\u201d from just inside the center circle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S8</id><text>The overall warm-up for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 lasted about 18 minutes and combined the new shadow pressing movements with a brief four-versus-one rondo and a short shooting sequence before Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began its own preparations on the opposite half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S9</id><text>In the opening half of the 2025-07-12 friendly, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 kept the score 0\u20130 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 repeatedly used two-player presses to force the ball toward the sidelines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S10</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 set up in a 2\u20132 defensive shape for most of the first half and repeatedly angled pressure toward the left sideline, funneling Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into rushed passes that rolled harmlessly over the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S11</id><text>Although the score remained 0\u20130 before halftime, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 managed three shots on target compared with one clear chance for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, whose close-range effort was beaten away at the near post by the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S12</id><text>Early in the second half on 2025-07-12, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger finished a fast counterattack from the right side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S13</id><text>The opening goal for Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived roughly three minutes after the restart when a misplaced square pass by a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender near the attacking third was intercepted and quickly relayed into a three-pass counter down the right flank.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S14</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger cut inside toward the edge of the area and drove a firm low shot across Meadowlane

2025-07-12, wide player Talen Priev equalized for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to make the score 1\u20131 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 with a low left-footed shot after intercepting a pass near halfway.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S16</id><text>The goal by wide player Talen Priev came around the ninth minute of the second half when Talen Priev stepped into a lateral pass near the center circle as Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sprung a coordinated press from the left side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S17</id><text>After carrying the ball roughly ten meters under pressure from a retreating Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender, Talen Priev opened his body and slid a left-footed finish inside the near post, drawing loud applause from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 supporters on the bleachers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S18</id><text>Throughout the second half on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll noted from the bench that the back line of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 shifted laterally and covered central space more consistently when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 activated paired presses inspired by Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S19</id><text>From his seat on the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 bench, coach Harven Soll periodically scribbled arrows and short comments on a clipboard, marking how the two central defenders tucked in behind the ball whenever Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pushed a first presser toward the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S20</id><text>Several times as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 tried to build through the middle, coach Harven Soll pointed toward the top of the penalty area and shouted reminders such as \u201cprotect the middle\u201d and \u201cclose the gap,\u201d prompting the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 back line to narrow their spacing compared with earlier in the season.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S21</id><text>After the final whistle of the 1\u20131 draw on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll told the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a brief huddle that the Pressing in Pairs-oriented work had improved the defensive shape of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 still needed to react faster to long diagonal passes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S22</id><text>The post-match huddle for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 formed near the center circle, with the players standing in a tight semicircle around coach Harven Soll, sweat-soaked bibs pulled over their school jerseys as they listened quietly to the feedback.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S23</id><text>Coach Harven Soll singled out one late Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attack that had exposed the far-post area, telling Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that upcoming sessions would focus on getting the weak-side defender to drop earlier whenever the opponent shaped to play a diagonal switch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S24</id><text>Following the post-match team talk on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll and visiting coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed at courtside that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 would arrange a second friendly later in July to further test the new pressing structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S25</id><text>While players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 shook hands and gathered scattered balls, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos stood near the halfway line comparing open dates in the last two weeks of July in their pocket notebooks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S26</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos remarked to coach Harven Soll that the adjusted pressing of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had forced Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into more long passes than usual, and both coaches discussed the possibility of recording short video clips of the next friendly for a joint post-game review.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S27</id><text>Later in the evening of 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll updated the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to schedule Pressing in Pairs-based defensive blocks twice a week in the remaining July sessions for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 before the school league begins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S28</id><text>At a kitchen table in the Meadowlane Quarter that evening, coach Harven Soll spread out the Meadowlane School

July.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S29</id><text>In the margin of the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll wrote a reminder to pair the defensive blocks with short

Futsal Club Under-17 arrived at Northline Community Sports Hall in Selvarin City for a scheduled full-length pre-season futsal rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S1</id><text>Both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 reached Northline Community Sports Hall shortly after 15:30 by a mix of school minibus and parent cars, aiming for a 16:00 kick-off within a 90-minute booking window.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S2</id><text>Northline Community Sports Hall offered a single full-size futsal court marked on light grey synthetic flooring under a high arched roof, with a small two-row bleacher section along one touchline where a handful of early-arriving parents took seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S3</id><text>Shortly after Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began changing at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos noticed a steady leak in the roof dripping onto one end of the futsal court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S4</id><text>The leak at Northline Community Sports Hall was first noticed when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 substitute heard drops hitting the floor near the far goalmouth and called coach Deren Kavos over while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were still pulling on their socks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S5</id><text>Within a few minutes, a palm-sized wet patch had formed just inside the penalty area line at one end of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, with water steadily dripping from a seam in the metal roof despite the hall attendant placing a plastic bucket nearby.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S6</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked the playing area at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed that the wet patch and spreading moisture made a standard forty-minute futsal match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 unsafe.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S7</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked slowly from sideline to sideline at Northline Community Sports Hall, testing the surface with the soles of their trainers and noting that the damp section already extended roughly four meters into the playing area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S8</id><text>After briefly consulting the hall attendant at Northline Community Sports Hall about the likelihood of the leak stopping and hearing that it had been a recurring issue during recent rain showers, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos concluded that any full-speed sprints toward that goal would pose too much risk of slipping.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos decided to mark off the damp third of the floor at Northline Community Sports Hall with cones and to shorten the available playing space so that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could still complete a controlled training session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S10</id><text>Using a set of bright orange flat cones brought by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and yellow dome cones from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos created a clear no-entry zone that effectively shortened the court to about two-thirds of its normal length at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S11</id><text>While coach Harven Soll quickly crossed out his planned full-match structure in his notebook and jotted down revised timings for drill blocks, coach Deren Kavos explained to a small cluster of puzzled players that the session at Northline Community Sports Hall would emphasize decision-making and pressing rather than match intensity.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S12</id><text>Before starting any ball work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 carried out a joint warm-up on the dry half of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, focusing on light mobility exercises and simple two-player passing patterns.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S13</id><text>The joint warm-up at Northline Community Sports Hall lasted around 15 minutes and began with slow jogging, hip-openers, ankle rolls, and arm swings led by coach Harven Soll before coach Deren Kavos introduced short side shuffles and gentle backward skips.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S14</id><text>After the mobility work at Northline Community Sports Hall, the two coaches paired players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 together in five-meter channels along the sideline to exchange firm right-foot and left-foot passes while calling each other\u2019s names to encourage communication.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S15</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos set up a camera identified as a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a fixed tripod at midcourt in Northline Community Sports Hall to record joint paired-pressing drills by Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 based on concepts from the article Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S16</id><text>The Ravelin VX-2 camcorder belonged to Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and had been brought to Northline Community Sports Hall in a padded black case, with coach Deren Kavos checking that the battery indicator was full and that a 32-gigabyte memory card provided enough space for the afternoon\u2019s work.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S17</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos positioned the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder at midcourt atop the second row of the bleachers at Northline Community Sports Hall, angling the lens slightly downward so the frame captured the entire dry half and the touchline along which the presses would be directed.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S18</id><text>In the main training block, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 mixed players into two balanced squads and ran repeated short sequences in which the first and second defender executed Pressing in Pairs cues toward the sideline while the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder captured every repetition.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S19</id><text>The mixed squads at Northline Community Sports Hall were balanced so that each included two regular defenders, two attackers, and a goalkeeper from across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, with colored bibs used to distinguish the sides regardless of school kit.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S20</id><text>During the main training block at Northline Community Sports Hall, sequences typically lasted 6 to 8 seconds as two defenders snapped into a coordinated press against three circulating attackers, after which coach Harven Soll or coach Deren Kavos would briefly freeze the play to reposition body angles or remind players of the \u201cstep and cover\u201d cue before restarting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S21</id><text>To conclude the on-court work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 played a single twelve-minute mixed-squad training game on the reduced court at Northline Community Sports Hall with informal rules that rewarded successful paired presses instead of keeping a formal score.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S22</id><text>For the twelve-minute mixed-squad training game at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches dubbed the teams \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cGreen\u201d based on bib color and instructed the players that each successful paired press in the attacking half earning a clear turnover would count as one point, even though no official scoreboard was used.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S23</id><text>To reduce physical strain on the shortened court at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches agreed on roll-on substitutions and relaxed restart rules, allowing quick kick-ins from the sidelines so that the flow of play remained centered on creating and responding to pressing situations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S24</id><text>After the session, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos reviewed a brief segment of the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder footage on the camera screen at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed to share the full recording between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 for a joint video-review meeting the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S25</id><text>After the final whistle at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos gathered near the tripod and replayed a 30-second clip in which a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arrived late as the second presser, using the pause button on the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to highlight spacing issues to the small group of nearby players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S26</id><text>Coach Harven Soll offered to copy the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder file from Northline Community Sports Hall onto a portable USB drive and to upload a version to a shared online folder so that both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could access the footage during the joint review planned for the middle of the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S27</id><text>Before leaving Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Deren Kavos and coach Harven Soll confirmed a new date in early August for a full rematch between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, explaining the revised plan to the assembled players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S28</id><text>In confirming the rearranged match at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos suggested an early-evening weekday slot in the first full week of August so that parents could attend after work, and coach Harven Soll checked his paper planner before nodding and noting the time beside the new fixture entry.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S29</id><text>As the players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered around at Northline Community Sports Hall to hear the explanation, several expressed disappointment at missing out on a full match that day, but both coaches stressed that the safer surface and additional video preparation would help make the August rematch more useful for everyone.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-29</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N5-S0</id><text>On the evening of 2025-07-29, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered in a meeting room at Varlen Crest Training Hall for a joint video-review session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S1</id><text>The joint video-review session began shortly after 18:30, with around twenty players and the two head coaches filing into a rectangular room furnished with three rows of plastic chairs facing a pull-down projection screen.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S2</id><text>The windows of the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room were tilted open to the warm summer air, and a faint echo of ball sounds from the main court nearby could be heard as the players settled into mixed groups rather than sitting strictly by team.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S3</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 connected the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to a ceiling-mounted Trinovar Castline P7 projector in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to display the 2025-07-24 training footage.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S4</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 used a short black HDMI cable to link the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to the Trinovar Castline P7 projector input panel, then dimmed the room lights so the footage appeared as a clear, wall-filling image near the far end of the meeting room.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S5</id><text>On the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder menu, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had already bookmarked four key clips by timestamp, allowing quick jumps between pressing sequences and build-up examples from the 2025-07-24 session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S6</id><text>Before starting the playback, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players that the main aim of the meeting was to refine shared \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d cues from both defensive and build-up perspectives.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S7</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 added that the evening was \u201cnot about blaming anyone on the screen, but about learning what our next decisions should look like,\u201d prompting several players from both squads to nod and shift forward in their seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S8</id><text>A few Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players quietly opened small spiral notebooks on their laps as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 spoke, ready to jot down any cues or passing patterns that might be useful in the August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to watch an early clip where Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 applied a sideline press and to focus on the body angles of the second defender.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S10</id><text>The selected clip from the 2025-07-24 recording showed a Blue-bibbed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arriving slightly square to the touchline on the right side, and coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 replayed the five-second action twice so everyone could see how that angle affected the trap.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S11</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pointed toward the projected image with the cap of his marker and asked the mixed group whether the second defender\u2019s front foot should be pointing more toward the ball or more toward the center, inviting short, one-word answers from the front row.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S12</id><text>During a paused frame of the same sequence, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 used a whiteboard in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to sketch the ideal positions for the first and second defender in the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S13</id><text>On the whiteboard, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 drew a simplified half-court diagram with small crosses for defenders, circles for attackers, and a bold arrow showing the first defender\u2019s pressing run toward the sideline while the second defender staggered half a step behind and slightly inside.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S14</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 wrote \u201c1.5 steps gap\u201d and \u201cbody half-open\u201d beside the second defender\u2019s symbol, explaining that this spacing allowed quick cover if the opponent cut inside or played a bounce pass back toward the middle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S15</id><text>In a later segment of the video, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 highlighted a passage where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 struggled to build out from the back against the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 press and invited Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to suggest alternative passing options.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S16</id><text>The paused scene showed the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper holding the ball with both flank options tightly marked and a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 forward closing in, and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 asked whether a quick diagonal pass to the pivot between the lines or a wall pass off the near defender would have been safer.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S17</id><text>One Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender raised a hand and suggested that a pre-agreed rotation, with the far-side defender stepping into the middle as a third option, could have created a clearer passing lane against the two-player press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S18</id><text>The goalkeepers from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 sat together in the front row while coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 replayed short goal-throw sequences to discuss how the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d cues influenced distribution choices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S19</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall leaned forward with elbows on his knees, occasionally jotting single words such as \u201cquick start\u201d and \u201clook weak side\u201d on a small notepad as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 paused and rewound individual throws.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S20</id><text>On one freeze-frame, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 traced an imaginary passing line across the bottom of the projected image, explaining to both goalkeepers how an early release toward the side opposite the incoming paired press could bypass two defenders before they locked the line.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S21</id><text>Midway through the session, a brief break at the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room allowed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to take water and snacks set out on a side table by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S22</id><text>The refreshments arranged by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin consisted of large plastic jugs of water, paper cups, sliced oranges, and a tray of small cheese-and-vegetable sandwiches laid out beside a stack of napkins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S23</id><text>During the five-minute pause, small mixed groups of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players chatted quietly about the toughest pressing drills from 2025-07-24 and compared who would likely start in the upcoming August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S24</id><text>In the final discussion block, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 jointly wrote three agreed verbal cues\u2014\u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d\u2014on the Varlen Crest Training Hall whiteboard as shared terminology for the upcoming August rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S25</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 printed the three phrases in large capital letters while coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 added a short explanation next to each, such as \u201clock line = no pass between us and the ball\u201d to make the meaning clear for both squads.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S26</id><text>Several players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 quickly took photos of the whiteboard on their phones after being encouraged by coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 to use the cues as standard language in their next team training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 handed the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players photocopied pages from the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly article \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress, marked with notes to apply specific drills in the next two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S28</id><text>On the photocopied pages, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had highlighted several paragraphs in yellow and circled two small-field exercises, writing timings like \u201cTue \u2013 15 min: 3v3 trap in corner\u201d in the margins to signal how they would be inserted into the upcoming schedule.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S29</id><text>As the meeting wrapped up, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players folded the marked handouts into their backpacks, with a few quietly remarking

screen.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-08-06</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N6-S0</id><text>On 2025-08-06, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club

school minibus still in their green-and-white warm-up tops while most Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players filtered in from nearby streets, with a receptionist at Varlen Crest Training Hall directing both squads toward the main court changing rooms.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S2</id><text>As the players unpacked boots and shin pads, a low hum from the hall\u2019s ventilation system and the squeak of another group finishing a prior booking set the backdrop for informal greetings and brief reminders from staff that this fixture replaced the abandoned match at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S3</id><text>The match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 kicked off at approximately 18:05 on the main court of

rematch.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S5</id><text>Roughly 40 to 50 spectators, including parents, siblings, and a few teammates from younger age groups, took seats along the sideline bleachers as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 in dark blue and Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in white and green lined up for the ceremonial handshakes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S6</id><text>In the 11th minute at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when winger Narel Vossin finished a fast counterattack with a low right-footed shot.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S7</id><text>The move began when a loose square pass from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near halfway was picked off and quickly shifted into a two-on-one break down the right, allowing Narel Vossin to cut inside onto his stronger foot before driving the ball across goalkeeper Riven Hall into the far corner.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S8</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 bench sprang to its feet as the electronic scoreboard flipped to 1\u20130, while two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defenders exchanged a brief glance and clapped their hands, urging teammates to tighten their next pressing sequence.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S9</id><text>Late in the first half at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 equalized to 1\u20131 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when wide player Talen Priev intercepted a pass created by a \u201cstep and cover\u201d press and scored from just inside the penalty area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S10</id><text>The equalizer arrived in the 18th minute when Talen Priev jumped a lateral pass near the left touchline, took one steadying touch inward, and snapped a low right-footed shot just inside the near post before the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could fully set his feet.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S11</id><text>As the ball hit the net, several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players shouted \u201clock line\u201d in unison, and coach Harven Soll quickly pointed to the pressing pair involved in the turnover, giving them a thumbs-up from the technical area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S12</id><text>Midway through the second half at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 went 2\u20131 ahead of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 midfielder Kelan Muvir converted a rebound from close range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S13</id><text>The decisive goal followed a firmly struck mid-range effort that the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could only parry into the middle of the area, where late-arriving midfielder Kelan Muvir reacted quickest to side-foot the loose ball in from around three meters out.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S14</id><text>Kelan Muvir wheeled away toward the corner with both arms raised before being surrounded by teammates, while referee Javren Mesk calmly signaled for the restart as the scoreboard ticked past the 10-minute mark of the second half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S15</id><text>Throughout both halves at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 consistently used the shared verbal cues \u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d to organize pressing actions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S16</id><text>The calls were loud enough that spectators could often hear entire pressing sequences being choreographed in real time, with the two coaches occasionally reinforcing a cue from the sidelines when a player hesitated between jumping to the ball or tucking in.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S17</id><text>On more than one occasion both teams shouted the same word at once during a contested build-up, drawing a brief ripple of amusement from the benches before attention snapped back to the ball.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S18</id><text>During the rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin operated a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a midcourt tripod to record the full match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S19</id><text>Selko Marin positioned the tripod on the first row of the central bleacher section near halfway, adjusted the zoom to capture both penalty areas, and checked that the red recording light stayed on as the match moved into its opening exchanges.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S20</id><text>During short stoppages, Selko Marin quietly noted goal times and a few key pressing situations on a folded sheet of paper so that coaches could later jump directly to those segments in the recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S21</id><text>After the final whistle confirming the 2\u20131 win for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 over Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, coach Harven Soll gathered Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near one goal at Varlen Crest Training Hall to praise the composure shown after falling behind.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S22</id><text>Standing just inside the penalty area, coach Harven Soll told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that \u201cwe stayed with our plan instead of chasing the game,\u201d highlighting how the equalizer and winner had both come from moments that began with disciplined pressing rather than rushed individual runs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S23</id><text>Several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players knelt to loosen their boots and stretch calves as they listened, sweat still dripping onto the wooden floor while they exchanged quick pats on the back and quiet congratulations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S24</id><text>In a separate post-match huddle at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos told Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 that Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had improved its pressing coordination against Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but needed sharper decision-making in possession.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S25</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos pointed to a late sequence where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 forced Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into a corner but then gave the ball away with a hurried diagonal pass, using it as an example of winning the press but not valuing the next touch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S26</id><text>A few Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players asked short questions about when to recycle through the goalkeeper or pivot under pressure, and coach Deren Kavos replied that these moments would be the main focus of the next week\u2019s training blocks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed to use the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder recording for a shorter follow-up joint video-review session later in August.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S28</id><text>Leaning over the edge of the court with their notebooks and phones out, the two coaches tentatively penciled in a midweek 45-minute slot before the start of the school league, agreeing that they would limit the session to a handful of key clips on pressing and build-out choices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S29</id><text>Selko Marin confirmed to both coaches that the full match file would be backed up onto an external drive that evening and exported into a shareable

around 18:15 on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll gathered twelve Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players on the indoor court of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in the Meadowlane Quarter of Selvarin City for an evening training session focused on defensive pressing.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S1</id><text>The group for the 2025-08-10 session included goalkeeper Riven Hall, winger Talen Priev, and midfielder Kelan Muvir, with the side doors of the warm, slightly echoing gym propped open to let in cooler evening air while the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S2</id><text>Coach Harven Soll had marked the training slot in his paper planner as an extended 18:15\u201319:45 block, telling the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players as they jogged in from the corridor that the entire 90 minutes would revolve around sharpening pressing habits from the recent 2\u20131 rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S3</id><text>Before the warm-up, coach Harven Soll used a school laptop connected to a portable projector to queue several short clips from the recent 2\u20131 match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, using video that Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin had exported from the original Ravelin VX-2 camcorder recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S4</id><text>The laptop and compact projector were set up on a low folding table at one end of the court, projecting the footage onto a blank section of the pale wall while audio played through the laptop\u2019s small speakers so that the crowd noise and shouted cues from Varlen Crest Training Hall were just audible over the hum of the ventilation system.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S5</id><text>The video file provided by staff member Selko Marin was organized into several bookmarked segments labeled with approximate match timestamps, allowing coach Harven Soll to jump directly to pressing situations from the first and second halves without having to scrub blindly through the full recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S6</id><text>Once the equipment was ready, coach Harven Soll told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that the goal of the 2025-08-10 session was to walk slowly through the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d structure from the article Pressing in Pairs using clips from Varlen Crest Training Hall before the upcoming joint video-review at Varlen Crest Training Hall with Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 coach Deren Kavos.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S7</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the projector glow behind him, coach Harven Soll asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players\u2014seated in a loose semicircle on the floor\u2014to treat the evening as \u201ca moving classroom,\u201d pointing toward a stack of photocopied Pressing in Pairs pages resting on the bench and reminding them that the joint review with coach Deren Kavos was expected to fall in the final week before the school league kicked off.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S8</id><text>In the first video segment on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll paused a clip of a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sideline press that had opened up in the middle and instructed four Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players to stand in the same positions on the court that appeared on the frozen image from Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S9</id><text>The paused clip came from an early first-half sequence in which Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had pressed down the right flank, and coach Harven Soll called out Talen Priev, Kelan Muvir, and two regular defenders by name to jog into the exact spots shown on the screen while the rest of the squad watched from the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S10</id><text>To help the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players match their spacing precisely, coach Harven Soll dropped four flat cones at their feet, adjusting each cone by a few centimeters as he compared the live positions to the frozen image of Varlen Crest Training Hall on the wall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S11</id><text>With the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players holding those positions, coach Harven Soll used a small whiteboard beside the court to sketch the same scene, labeling the first and second defender in line with the terminology from Pressing in Pairs and underlining the cue phrase \u201cstep and cover.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S12</id><text>Coach Harven Soll used a red marker to draw the first defender and a blue marker for the second defender, adding black arrows to show the ideal shuffle path and a small shaded box to represent the central space that had been left exposed in the original action.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S13</id><text>After finishing the rough diagram, coach Harven Soll turned the whiteboard toward the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and asked the four on-court demonstrators whether the sketched distances matched how the situation had felt in the game, prompting a brief discussion about how far the second defender should have tucked inside.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S14</id><text>In the next clip that coach Harven Soll chose from the Varlen Crest Training Hall recording, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had to drop out of a high press, and coach Harven Soll replayed the five-second sequence three times to emphasize the moment when the \u201creset block\u201d instruction should be called by the back line.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S15</id><text>With the volume turned up, the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players could hear that no one actually shouted \u201creset block\u201d until after Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had already switched the ball to the far side, and coach Harven Soll paused on that frame to ask which defender should take responsibility for giving the early command.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S16</id><text>Coach Harven Soll tapped the projected image where the two deepest Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were visible and suggested that the left-sided defender or, failing that, goalkeeper Riven Hall needed to be the designated voice in such moments so that the whole unit could drop in time.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S17</id><text>After the initial video work on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll divided Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into two groups of five players and asked each group to rehearse a slow-motion \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d walk-through from the halfway line toward a corner without a ball while coach Harven Soll counted their steps aloud.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S18</id><text>The remaining two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players, including goalkeeper Riven Hall, initially observed from just outside the touchline before rotating into the patterns on the second and third repetitions so that every player practiced both the first and second defender roles.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S19</id><text>As each group shuffled from the halfway line toward the wall, coach Harven Soll counted \u201cone\u201d through \u201ceight\u201d in a firm voice, stopping the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pairs if they had not reached the imagined trap line by the sixth step and nudging them a little closer together with his hands.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S20</id><text>During a later block of the 2025-08-10 session, coach Harven Soll placed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall in front of one goal and arranged cones to represent Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attackers so that Riven Hall could practice goal throws aimed at spaces that a coordinated \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d press would be likely to leave open.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S21</id><text>The cones in front of goalkeeper Riven Hall were set out in two staggered lines in red and

preferred target area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S22</id><text>In sets of a dozen repetitions, coach Harven Soll called out cues such as \u201cweak side\u201d or \u201cearly bounce,\u201d timing how

press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S23</id><text>To conclude the on-court segment on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll instructed every Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 player to select one key phrase from Pressing in Pairs, such as \u201clock line\u201d or \u201creset block,\u201d and to call out that phrase each time the player stepped into a pressing action during a final five-minute shadow pressing sequence.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S24</id><text>Some Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players chose the more descriptive cues that coach Harven Soll had written on the whiteboard earlier, shouting words like \u201cbody half-open\u201d or \u201cprotect middle\u201d as they moved, so that the court was filled with overlapping calls every time a pair slid into position.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S25</id><text>During the last minute of the shadow pressing sequence, the synchronized movements and sharp verbal cues from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players echoed off the high ceiling, drawing a curious glance from a school caretaker wheeling a trolley past the open doorway.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S26</id><text>After the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players left the indoor court on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll remained at Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to re-watch two Varlen Crest Training Hall clips on the laptop, adding

on the selected sentences, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the absolute date or time within each of the selected sentences if possible. If a sentence doesn't provide additional time information, use the event date as time information. Remember that the dates of individual sub-events within each event may differ from the event date. To compute the specific points in time, check if the selected sentences specify any of the following:\n   - Relative time information (e.g., \"six weeks ago\", \"in five days\", \"after two hours\") based on which you can compute a specific point in time\n   - Absolute time information (e.g., \"10:00 am\", \"March 22nd\")\n   - You can always assume that the date listed for each event is known. The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. \n   - If the specific points in time cannot be asserted with certainty but only estimated based on some likelihood, specify assumptions under which you can derive absolute points in time\n   - If the sentences describe durations, list the respective start and end dates/times together with the assumptions\n\n2. Think about the different options of absolute points of time and which time span between them would be most challenging to compute, ensuring that all selected sentences are required to compute the duration.\n\n3. Draft a specific question that asks for the time duration. This question can only be solved if one derives the absolute points in time from each of the selected sentences. The question must always ask about the duration between two points in time. Prefer time durations that differ from the absolute durations of the respective event (if multiple options of different possible ways to compute durations exist).\n\n4. Formulate a precise and correct answer to the question, which must be an absolute duration. Only use the information from the selected sentences and make the question very specific to avoid ambiguities. In the scratchpad, include a derivation of the answer using the absolute dates you estimated before.\n\n5. Ensure the validity of the questions:\n   - Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present.\n   - Make sure that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n   - Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to answer the question and that no other sentence from the <complete_outline> can replace any of the selected sentence in answering the question.\n   - Adjust the question accordingly to fulfill these criteria by making it more specific.\n\n6. Avoid absolute dates or times in your question if possible:\n   - If you needed to make an assumption about when something happened, try to explain it relative to other existing events or information from the <complete_outline>. Try to replace explicitly mentioned dates by anchoring them into some content of the <complete_outline> instead. If necessary, add the additional required sentence ID to your result and explain the unique information of this sentence that is necessary.\n   - Make sure that temporal reasoning is still required in the revised question. Double-check if the temporal information is still essential to answer the question after resolving the absolute dates. Think about different options (like start and end dates) to make sure that one must apply temporal reasoning to answer the question.\n\n7. If you must integrate additional information beyond what is specified within the selected sentences:\n   - Identify the unique information you must add to the question within the provided <complete_outline> and select the sentence communicating this unique information\n   - Explain what kind of unique information from this sentence is needed and why\n   - List the sentence ID of the newly selected sentence in your result\n   - Rewrite your question accordingly and ensure that all points listed in step 5 are valid when adding the newly selected sentence\n\nProvide your reasoning in the following format:\n<scratchpad>\n(Repeat for all sentence IDs)\n[Sentence ID]:\n- [Describe the time information from this sentence]\n- [Identify the event date]\nAssumptions:\n- [Make your assumptions explicit]\nAbsolute dates:\n- [List all relevant absolute dates from this sentence. Justify how they relate to the event date or other date information.]\n\n\nAdditional sentences:\n[Think about additional sentence IDs to add and explain your decision and what information from the sentence you require. List any new absolute dates based on this information.]\n\nQuestion Idea:\n[Outline how to create a challenging time-span question based on the absolute dates and selected information]\n- [For each selected sentence, specifically elaborate the unique information from this sentence that is required to answer the question. Think about how to frame the question without explicitly stating this unique information.]\n\n[Answer derivation]:\nCompute the answer using the absolute dates from above.\n\n<scratchpad>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<qa>\n<question>[Your generated question about the time span]</question>\n<answer>[The precise and concise answer to the question]</answer>\n<additional_sentence_ids>[List of additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, if applicable]</additional_sentence_ids>\n<additional_sentence_explanation>[Explain the unique information of each additional sentence that is required to answer the question and justify why it is needed, if applicable]</additional_sentence_explanation>\n</qa>\n</results>\n\nRemember to make your question as specific as possible, ensuring that it can only be answered using the information from the selected sentences (and any additional sentences you may need to include). If you need to make assumptions, state them clearly in the question. Always provide a precise and concise answer to the question you generate.\n\nImportant reminders:\n- While each event provides a unique date, which can be helpful to identify the question, the provided date does not necessarily apply to all information listed in the event outline (or the selected sentences extracted from the event outline). The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. Think carefully about how the event date applies to the selected sentences before you start drafting your question. Some events may have happened in the past even though they are not described in the past tense. Use your common sense and the sequence of sentences within the event. If you are reasonably uncertain, make your assumption explicit and include it in your question.\n- Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present, and that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n- Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to infer the correct answer.\n- If you need to include additional sentences, clearly explain why they are necessary and what unique information they provide.\n- In your question clearly indicate if some point in time happens in the future as such (for example when including the planned end date of an ongoing or planned event).\n- In your question, DO NOT include the required temporal information. The temporal information must be inferred from the content of the selected sentences.\n- DO NOT create questions about time-spans that mix units that cannot be compared in a meaningful way (such as minutes and days, days and years).\n- If you make assumptions, make sure they are plausible.\n- If you rely on the event date, carefully assess if the whether the information likely occurred before or after the event date.\n- State your assumptions that are required to answer the question clearly in the question.\n- Make sure that the question cannot be answered without considering unique content from ALL selected evidence sentences (from <selected_sentences> and <additional_sentence_ids>)\n- Explicitly compute and list all dates, including start and end dates, based on your assumptions before you draft your question.\n- The answer should only consist of the correct time span and should not be a complete sentence.\n- Ensure that you DO NOT explicitly refer to absolute dates or relative time spans (from the selected sentences) in the question. It is important that answering the question requires extracting this information from these sentences.",

cones.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S14</id><text>During the ball-control segment on 2025-07-03, captain Mikel Ardan and flank player Sera Noll were asked by head coach Marlen Tiravo to demonstrate a sequence of inside-outside touches at one station before the rest of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 repeated the pattern at a slower tempo.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S15</id><text>During the middle phase of the 2025-07-03 practice, fitness coach Kelran Dov led Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 through low-intensity agility patterns over the new ladders and mini-hurdles to reintroduce movement mechanics without imposing heavy physical load.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S16</id><text>The agility phase run by fitness coach Kelran Dov on 2025-07-03 featured simple in-in-out foot

an emphasis on clean technique.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S19</id><text>For the finishing drills on 2025-07-03, the two portable goals were placed about nine meters from the end lines on opposite sides of the court, and Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players worked in pairs combining a wall pass and a controlled first touch before shooting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S20</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo encouraged the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players to alternate between dominant and weaker feet during the finishing segment and frequently stopped sequences to praise composed body shape or a well-placed low shot into the corners.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S21</id><text>At a brief pause before the last exercise block on 2025-07-03, head coach Marlen Tiravo told the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 that pressing drills and transition games would be deliberately postponed until the following week so that the team could first adjust to the new equipment.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S22</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the squad gathered around, head coach Marlen Tiravo explained that he wanted Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to \u201clearn exactly how these balls move on the floor before we ask you to sprint and press again,\u201d prompting several players to nod in agreement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S23</id><text>Head coach Marlen Tiravo also reminded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the pause that the concepts from the recent \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d article would still be part of the upcoming training cycle, but that 2025-07-03 was intended as a technical reset rather than an intense tactical session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S24</id><text>Toward the end of the 2025-07-03 training, goalkeeper Ren Talvek completed a short series of catching and distribution routines with the new futsal balls under the guidance of head coach Marlen Tiravo to assess the bounce and grip for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S25</id><text>Goalkeeper Ren Talvek\u2019s short block of work on 2025-07-03 included sets of low driven shots along the floor, high looping balls dropped from head coach Marlen Tiravo\u2019s hands, and side-arm throws toward marked zones near the touchline to test both handling and passing range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S26</id><text>After one sequence in which a shot skimmed off his gloves, goalkeeper Ren Talvek commented to head coach Marlen Tiravo that the new futsal balls felt \u201ca touch livelier off the surface\u201d than the previous batch, and the pair briefly discussed adjusting his stance for low saves.</text></item>\n<item><id>N2-S27</id><text>After the 2025-07-03 session, head coach Marlen Tiravo sent a brief email from the office of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy to development coordinator

Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S4</id><text>The pre-match meeting for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 took place in a narrow changing room beside the indoor court, where coach Harven Soll

players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll emphasized to Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that the goal of the friendly against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 was to

twos.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S6</id><text>During the pre-match warm-up on 2025-07-12, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 ran their first on-court version of a paired pressing shadow drill adapted from Pressing in Pairs under the direct supervision of coach Harven Soll.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S7</id><text>In the paired pressing shadow drill, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players worked in twos along the halfway line, sliding sideways in unison to close imaginary passing lanes while coach Harven Soll shouted cues such as \u201cstep and cover\u201d and \u201cshow outside\u201d from just inside the center circle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S8</id><text>The overall warm-up for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 lasted about 18 minutes and combined the new shadow pressing movements with a brief four-versus-one rondo and a short shooting sequence before Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began its own preparations on the opposite half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S9</id><text>In the opening half of the 2025-07-12 friendly, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 kept the score 0\u20130 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 repeatedly used two-player presses to force the ball toward the sidelines.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S10</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 set up in a 2\u20132 defensive shape for most of the first half and repeatedly angled pressure toward the left sideline, funneling Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into rushed passes that rolled harmlessly over the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S11</id><text>Although the score remained 0\u20130 before halftime, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 managed three shots on target compared with one clear chance for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, whose close-range effort was beaten away at the near post by the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S12</id><text>Early in the second half on 2025-07-12, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger finished a fast counterattack from the right side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S13</id><text>The opening goal for Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived roughly three minutes after the restart when a misplaced square pass by a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender near the attacking third was intercepted and quickly relayed into a three-pass counter down the right flank.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S14</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 winger cut inside toward the edge of the area and drove a firm low shot across Meadowlane

a pass near halfway.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S16</id><text>The goal by wide player Talen Priev came around the ninth minute of the second half when Talen Priev stepped into a lateral pass near the center circle as Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sprung a coordinated press from the left side.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S17</id><text>After carrying the ball roughly ten meters under pressure from a retreating Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender, Talen Priev opened his body and slid a left-footed finish inside the near post, drawing loud applause from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 supporters on the bleachers.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S18</id><text>Throughout the second half on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll noted from the bench that the back line of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 shifted laterally and covered central space more consistently when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 activated paired presses inspired by Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S19</id><text>From his seat on the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 bench, coach Harven Soll periodically scribbled arrows and short comments on a clipboard,

touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S20</id><text>Several times as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 tried to build through the middle, coach Harven Soll pointed toward the top of the penalty area and shouted reminders such as \u201cprotect the middle\u201d and \u201cclose the gap,\u201d prompting the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 back line to narrow their spacing compared with earlier in the season.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S21</id><text>After the final whistle of the 1\u20131 draw on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll told the players of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in a brief huddle that the Pressing in Pairs-oriented work had improved the defensive shape of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 still needed to react faster to long diagonal passes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S22</id><text>The post-match huddle for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 formed near the center circle, with the players standing in a tight semicircle around coach Harven Soll, sweat-soaked bibs pulled over their school jerseys as they listened quietly to the feedback.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S23</id><text>Coach Harven Soll singled out one late Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attack that had exposed the far-post area, telling Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 that upcoming sessions would focus on getting the weak-side defender to drop earlier whenever the opponent shaped to play a diagonal switch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S24</id><text>Following the post-match team talk on 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll and visiting coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed at courtside that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 would arrange a second friendly later in July to further test the new pressing structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S25</id><text>While players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 shook hands and gathered scattered balls, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos stood near the halfway line comparing open dates in the last two weeks of July in their pocket notebooks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S26</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos remarked to coach Harven Soll that the adjusted pressing of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had forced Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 into more long passes than usual, and both coaches discussed the possibility of recording short video clips of the next friendly for a joint post-game review.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S27</id><text>Later in the evening of 2025-07-12, coach Harven Soll updated the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to schedule Pressing in Pairs-based defensive blocks twice a week in the remaining July sessions for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 before the school league begins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S28</id><text>At a kitchen table in the Meadowlane Quarter that evening, coach Harven Soll spread out the Meadowlane School

July.</text></item>\n<item><id>N3-S29</id><text>In the margin of the planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll wrote a reminder to pair the defensive blocks with short

fixtures.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-24</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N4-S0</id><text>On the afternoon of 2025-07-24, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 arrived at Northline Community Sports Hall in Selvarin City for a scheduled full-length pre-season futsal rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S1</id><text>Both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 reached Northline Community Sports Hall shortly after 15:30 by a mix of school minibus and parent cars, aiming for a 16:00 kick-off within a 90-minute booking window.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S2</id><text>Northline Community Sports Hall offered a single full-size futsal court marked on light grey synthetic flooring under a high arched roof, with a small two-row bleacher section along one touchline where a handful of early-arriving parents took seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S3</id><text>Shortly after Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 began changing at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos noticed a steady leak in the roof dripping onto one end of the futsal court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S4</id><text>The leak at Northline Community Sports Hall was first noticed when a Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 substitute heard drops hitting the floor near the far goalmouth and called coach Deren Kavos over while Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were still pulling on their socks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S5</id><text>Within a few minutes, a palm-sized wet patch had formed just inside the penalty area line at one end of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, with water steadily dripping from a seam in the metal roof despite the hall attendant placing a plastic bucket nearby.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S6</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked the playing area at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed that the wet patch and spreading moisture made a standard forty-minute futsal match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 unsafe.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S7</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos walked slowly from sideline to sideline at Northline Community Sports Hall, testing the surface with the soles of their trainers and noting that the damp section already extended roughly four meters into the playing area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S8</id><text>After briefly consulting the hall attendant at Northline Community Sports Hall about the likelihood of the leak stopping and hearing that it had been a recurring issue during recent rain showers, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos concluded that any full-speed sprints toward that goal would pose too much risk of slipping.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos decided to mark off the damp third of the floor at Northline Community Sports Hall with cones and to shorten the available playing space so that Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could still complete a controlled training session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S10</id><text>Using a set of bright orange flat cones brought by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and yellow dome cones from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos created a clear no-entry zone that effectively shortened the court to about two-thirds of its normal length at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S11</id><text>While coach Harven Soll quickly crossed out his planned full-match structure in his notebook and jotted down revised timings for drill blocks, coach Deren Kavos explained to a small cluster of puzzled players that the session at Northline Community Sports Hall would emphasize decision-making and pressing rather than match intensity.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S12</id><text>Before starting any ball work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 carried out a joint warm-up on the dry half of the court at Northline Community Sports Hall, focusing on light mobility exercises and simple two-player passing patterns.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S13</id><text>The joint warm-up at Northline Community Sports Hall lasted around 15 minutes and began with slow jogging, hip-openers, ankle rolls, and arm swings led by coach Harven Soll before coach Deren Kavos introduced short side shuffles and gentle backward skips.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S14</id><text>After the mobility work at Northline Community Sports Hall, the two coaches paired players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 together in five-meter channels along the sideline to exchange firm right-foot and left-foot passes while calling each other\u2019s names to encourage communication.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S15</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos set up a camera identified as a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a fixed tripod at midcourt in Northline Community Sports Hall to record joint paired-pressing drills by Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 based on concepts from the article Pressing in Pairs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S16</id><text>The Ravelin VX-2 camcorder belonged to Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 and had been brought to Northline Community Sports Hall in a padded black case, with coach Deren Kavos checking that the battery indicator was full and that a 32-gigabyte memory card provided enough space for the afternoon\u2019s work.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S17</id><text>Coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos positioned the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder at midcourt atop the second row of the bleachers at Northline Community Sports Hall, angling the lens slightly downward so the frame captured the entire dry half and the touchline along which the presses would be directed.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S18</id><text>In the main training block, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 mixed players into two balanced squads and ran repeated short sequences in which the first and second defender executed Pressing in Pairs cues toward the sideline while the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder captured every repetition.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S19</id><text>The mixed squads at Northline Community Sports Hall were balanced so that each included two regular defenders, two attackers, and a goalkeeper from across Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, with colored bibs used to distinguish the sides regardless of school kit.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S20</id><text>During the main training block at Northline Community Sports Hall, sequences typically lasted 6 to 8 seconds as two defenders snapped into a coordinated press against three circulating attackers, after which coach Harven Soll or coach Deren Kavos would briefly freeze the play to reposition body angles or remind players of the \u201cstep and cover\u201d cue before restarting.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S21</id><text>To conclude the on-court work, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 played a single twelve-minute mixed-squad training game on the reduced court at Northline Community Sports Hall with informal rules that rewarded successful paired presses instead of keeping a formal score.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S22</id><text>For the twelve-minute mixed-squad training game at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches dubbed the teams \u201cBlue\u201d and \u201cGreen\u201d based on bib color and instructed the players that each successful paired press in the attacking half earning a clear turnover would count as one point, even though no official scoreboard was used.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S23</id><text>To reduce physical strain on the shortened court at Northline Community Sports Hall, the coaches agreed on roll-on substitutions and relaxed restart rules, allowing quick kick-ins from the sidelines so that the flow of play remained centered on creating and responding to pressing situations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S24</id><text>After the session, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos reviewed a brief segment of the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder footage on the camera screen at Northline Community Sports Hall and agreed to share the full recording between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 for a joint video-review meeting the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S25</id><text>After the final whistle at Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Harven Soll and coach Deren Kavos gathered near the tripod and replayed a 30-second clip in which a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arrived late as the second presser, using the pause button on the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to highlight spacing issues to the small group of nearby players.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S26</id><text>Coach Harven Soll offered to copy the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder file from Northline Community Sports Hall onto a portable USB drive and to upload a version to a shared online folder so that both Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 could access the footage during the joint review planned for the middle of the following week.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S27</id><text>Before leaving Northline Community Sports Hall, coach Deren Kavos and coach Harven Soll confirmed a new date in early August for a full rematch between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, explaining the revised plan to the assembled players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S28</id><text>In confirming the rearranged match at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos suggested an early-evening weekday slot in the first full week of August so that parents could attend after work, and coach Harven Soll checked his paper planner before nodding and noting the time beside the new fixture entry.</text></item>\n<item><id>N4-S29</id><text>As the players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered around at Northline Community Sports Hall to hear the explanation, several expressed disappointment at missing out on a full match that day, but both coaches stressed that the safer surface and additional video preparation would help make the August rematch more useful for everyone.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-07-29</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N5-S0</id><text>On the evening of 2025-07-29, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 gathered in a meeting room at Varlen Crest Training Hall for a joint video-review session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S1</id><text>The joint video-review session began shortly after 18:30, with around twenty players and the two head coaches filing into a rectangular room furnished with three rows of plastic chairs facing a pull-down projection screen.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S2</id><text>The windows of the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room were tilted open to the warm summer air, and a faint echo of ball sounds from the main court nearby could be heard as the players settled into mixed groups rather than sitting strictly by team.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S3</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 connected the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to a ceiling-mounted Trinovar Castline P7 projector in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to display the 2025-07-24 training footage.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S4</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 used a short black HDMI cable to link the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder to the Trinovar Castline P7 projector input panel, then dimmed the room lights so the footage appeared as a clear, wall-filling image near the far end of the meeting room.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S5</id><text>On the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder menu, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had already bookmarked four key clips by timestamp, allowing quick jumps between pressing sequences and build-up examples from the 2025-07-24 session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S6</id><text>Before starting the playback, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players that the main aim of the meeting was to refine shared \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d cues from both defensive and build-up perspectives.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S7</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 added that the evening was \u201cnot about blaming anyone on the screen, but about learning what our next decisions should look like,\u201d prompting several players from both squads to nod and shift forward in their seats.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S8</id><text>A few Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players quietly opened small spiral notebooks on their laps as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 spoke, ready to jot down any cues or passing patterns that might be useful in the August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S9</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to watch an early clip where Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 applied a sideline press and to focus on the body angles of the second defender.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S10</id><text>The selected clip from the 2025-07-24 recording showed a Blue-bibbed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defender arriving slightly square to the touchline on the right side, and coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 replayed the five-second action twice so everyone could see how that angle affected the trap.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S11</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pointed toward the projected image with the cap of his marker and asked the mixed group whether the second defender\u2019s front foot should be pointing more toward the ball or more toward the center, inviting short, one-word answers from the front row.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S12</id><text>During a paused frame of the same sequence, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 used a whiteboard in the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room to sketch the ideal positions for the first and second defender in the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d structure.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S13</id><text>On the whiteboard, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 drew a simplified half-court diagram with small crosses for defenders, circles for attackers, and a bold arrow showing the first defender\u2019s pressing run toward the sideline while the second defender staggered half a step behind and slightly inside.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S14</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 wrote \u201c1.5 steps gap\u201d and \u201cbody half-open\u201d beside the second defender\u2019s symbol, explaining that this spacing allowed quick cover if the opponent cut inside or played a bounce pass back toward the middle.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S15</id><text>In a later segment of the video, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 highlighted a passage where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 struggled to build out from the back against the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 press and invited Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to suggest alternative passing options.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S16</id><text>The paused scene showed the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper holding the ball with both flank options tightly marked and a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 forward closing in, and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 asked whether a quick diagonal pass to the pivot between the lines or a wall pass off the near defender would have been safer.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S17</id><text>One Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 defender raised a hand and suggested that a pre-agreed rotation, with the far-side defender stepping into the middle as a third option, could have created a clearer passing lane against the two-player press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S18</id><text>The goalkeepers from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 sat together in the front row while coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 replayed short goal-throw sequences to discuss how the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d cues influenced distribution choices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S19</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall leaned forward with elbows on his knees, occasionally jotting single words such as \u201cquick start\u201d and \u201clook weak side\u201d on a small notepad as coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 paused and rewound individual throws.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S20</id><text>On one freeze-frame, coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 traced an imaginary passing line across the bottom of the projected image, explaining to both goalkeepers how an early release toward the side opposite the incoming paired press could bypass two defenders before they locked the line.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S21</id><text>Midway through the session, a brief break at the Varlen Crest Training Hall meeting room allowed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players to take water and snacks set out on a side table by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S22</id><text>The refreshments arranged by Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin consisted of large plastic jugs of water, paper cups, sliced oranges, and a tray of small cheese-and-vegetable sandwiches laid out beside a stack of napkins.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S23</id><text>During the five-minute pause, small mixed groups of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players chatted quietly about the toughest pressing drills from 2025-07-24 and compared who would likely start in the upcoming August rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S24</id><text>In the final discussion block, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 jointly wrote three agreed verbal cues\u2014\u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d\u2014on the Varlen Crest Training Hall whiteboard as shared terminology for the upcoming August rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S25</id><text>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 printed the three phrases in large capital letters while coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 added a short explanation next to each, such as \u201clock line = no pass between us and the ball\u201d to make the meaning clear for both squads.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S26</id><text>Several players from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 quickly took photos of the whiteboard on their phones after being encouraged by coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 to use the cues as standard language in their next team training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 handed the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players photocopied pages from the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly article \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress, marked with notes to apply specific drills in the next two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 training sessions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S28</id><text>On the photocopied pages, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had highlighted several paragraphs in yellow and circled two small-field exercises, writing timings like \u201cTue \u2013 15 min: 3v3 trap in corner\u201d in the margins to signal how they would be inserted into the upcoming schedule.</text></item>\n<item><id>N5-S29</id><text>As the meeting wrapped up, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players folded the marked handouts into their backpacks, with a few quietly remarking

Under-17 arrived at Varlen Crest Training Hall shortly after 17:30 for the rescheduled early-evening rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S1</id><text>Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 stepped off a school minibus still in their green-and-white warm-up tops while most Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players filtered in from nearby streets, with a receptionist at Varlen Crest Training Hall directing both squads toward the main court changing rooms.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S2</id><text>As the players unpacked boots and shin pads, a low hum from the hall\u2019s ventilation system and the squeak of another group finishing a prior booking set the backdrop for informal greetings and brief reminders from staff that this fixture replaced the abandoned match at Northline Community Sports Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S3</id><text>The match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 kicked off at approximately 18:05 on the main court of Varlen Crest Training Hall under the officiating of referee Javren Mesk.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S4</id><text>Referee Javren Mesk gathered both captains at the center circle before kick-off to confirm two 20-minute halves with a running clock and to stress quick restarts and respectful communication during what he described as \u201ca high-energy, but friendly, rematch.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S5</id><text>Roughly 40 to 50 spectators, including parents, siblings, and a few teammates from younger age groups, took seats along the sideline bleachers as Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 in dark blue and Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in white and green lined up for the ceremonial handshakes.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S6</id><text>In the 11th minute at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 took a 1\u20130 lead over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 when winger Narel Vossin finished a fast counterattack with a low right-footed shot.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S7</id><text>The move began when a loose square pass from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near halfway was picked off and quickly shifted into a two-on-one break down the right, allowing Narel Vossin to cut inside onto his stronger foot before driving the ball across goalkeeper Riven Hall into the far corner.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S8</id><text>The Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 bench sprang to its feet as the electronic scoreboard flipped to 1\u20130, while two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defenders exchanged a brief glance and clapped their hands, urging teammates to tighten their next pressing sequence.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S9</id><text>Late in the first half at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 equalized to 1\u20131 against Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when wide player Talen Priev intercepted a pass created by a \u201cstep and cover\u201d press and scored from just inside the penalty area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S10</id><text>The equalizer arrived in the 18th minute when Talen Priev jumped a lateral pass near the left touchline, took one steadying touch inward, and snapped a low right-footed shot just inside the near post before the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could fully set his feet.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S11</id><text>As the ball hit the net, several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players shouted \u201clock line\u201d in unison, and coach Harven Soll quickly pointed to the pressing pair involved in the turnover, giving them a thumbs-up from the technical area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S12</id><text>Midway through the second half at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 went 2\u20131 ahead of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 when Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 midfielder Kelan Muvir converted a rebound from close range.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S13</id><text>The decisive goal followed a firmly struck mid-range effort that the Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 goalkeeper could only parry into the middle of the area, where late-arriving midfielder Kelan Muvir reacted quickest to side-foot the loose ball in from around three meters out.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S14</id><text>Kelan Muvir wheeled away toward the corner with both arms raised before being surrounded by teammates, while referee Javren Mesk calmly signaled for the restart as the scoreboard ticked past the 10-minute mark of the second half.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S15</id><text>Throughout both halves at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 consistently used the shared verbal cues \u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d to organize pressing actions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S16</id><text>The calls were loud enough that spectators could often hear entire pressing sequences being choreographed in real time, with the two coaches occasionally reinforcing a cue from the sidelines when a player hesitated between jumping to the ball or tucking in.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S17</id><text>On more than one occasion both teams shouted the same word at once during a contested build-up, drawing a brief ripple of amusement from the benches before attention snapped back to the ball.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S18</id><text>During the rematch at Varlen Crest Training Hall, Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin operated a Ravelin VX-2 camcorder on a midcourt tripod to record the full match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S19</id><text>Selko Marin positioned the tripod on the first row of the central bleacher section near halfway, adjusted the zoom to capture both penalty areas, and checked that the red recording light stayed on as the match moved into its opening exchanges.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S20</id><text>During short stoppages, Selko Marin quietly noted goal times and a few key pressing situations on a folded sheet of paper so that coaches could later jump directly to those segments in the recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S21</id><text>After the final whistle confirming the 2\u20131 win for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 over Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17, coach Harven Soll gathered Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 near one goal at Varlen Crest Training Hall to praise the composure shown after falling behind.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S22</id><text>Standing just inside the penalty area, coach Harven Soll told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that \u201cwe stayed with our plan instead of chasing the game,\u201d highlighting how the equalizer and winner had both come from moments that began with disciplined pressing rather than rushed individual runs.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S23</id><text>Several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players knelt to loosen their boots and stretch calves as they listened, sweat still dripping onto the wooden floor while they exchanged quick pats on the back and quiet congratulations.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S24</id><text>In a separate post-match huddle at Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Deren Kavos told Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 that Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had improved its pressing coordination against Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 but needed sharper decision-making in possession.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S25</id><text>Coach Deren Kavos pointed to a late sequence where Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 forced Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into a corner but then gave the ball away with a hurried diagonal pass, using it as an example of winning the press but not valuing the next touch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S26</id><text>A few Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 players asked short questions about when to recycle through the goalkeeper or pivot under pressure, and coach Deren Kavos replied that these moments would be the main focus of the next week\u2019s training blocks.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S27</id><text>Before leaving Varlen Crest Training Hall, coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and coach Deren Kavos of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 agreed to use the Ravelin VX-2 camcorder recording for a shorter follow-up joint video-review session later in August.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S28</id><text>Leaning over the edge of the court with their notebooks and phones out, the two coaches tentatively penciled in a midweek 45-minute slot before the start of the school league, agreeing that they would limit the session to a handful of key clips on pressing and build-out choices.</text></item>\n<item><id>N6-S29</id><text>Selko Marin confirmed to both coaches that the full match file would be backed up onto an external drive that evening and exported into a shareable format so each staff could review segments on their own ahead of the joint meeting.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-08-10</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N7-S0</id><text>At around 18:15 on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll gathered twelve Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players on the indoor court of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 in the Meadowlane Quarter of Selvarin City for an evening training session focused on defensive pressing.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S1</id><text>The group for the 2025-08-10 session included goalkeeper Riven Hall, winger Talen Priev, and midfielder Kelan Muvir, with the side doors of the warm, slightly echoing gym propped open to let in cooler evening air while the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S2</id><text>Coach Harven Soll had marked the training slot in his paper planner as an extended 18:15\u201319:45 block, telling the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players as they jogged in from the corridor that the entire 90 minutes would revolve around sharpening pressing habits from the recent 2\u20131 rematch.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S3</id><text>Before the warm-up, coach Harven Soll used a school laptop connected to a portable projector to queue several short clips from the recent 2\u20131 match between Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 at Varlen Crest Training Hall, using video that Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 staff member Selko Marin had exported from the original Ravelin VX-2 camcorder recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S4</id><text>The laptop and compact projector were set up on a low folding table at one end of the court, projecting the footage onto a blank section of the pale wall while audio played through the laptop\u2019s small speakers so that the crowd noise and shouted cues from Varlen Crest Training Hall were just audible over the hum of the ventilation system.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S5</id><text>The video file provided by staff member Selko Marin was organized into several bookmarked segments labeled with approximate match timestamps, allowing coach Harven Soll to jump directly to pressing situations from the first and second halves without having to scrub blindly through the full recording.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S6</id><text>Once the equipment was ready, coach Harven Soll told the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that the goal of the 2025-08-10 session was to walk slowly through the \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d structure from the article Pressing in Pairs using clips from Varlen Crest Training Hall before the upcoming joint video-review at Varlen Crest Training Hall with Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 coach Deren Kavos.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S7</id><text>Standing near the center circle with the projector glow behind him, coach Harven Soll asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players\u2014seated in a loose semicircle on the floor\u2014to treat the evening as \u201ca moving classroom,\u201d pointing toward a stack of photocopied Pressing in Pairs pages resting on the bench and reminding them that the joint review with coach Deren Kavos was expected to fall in the final week before the school league kicked off.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S8</id><text>In the first video segment on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll paused a clip of a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 sideline press that had opened up in the middle and instructed four Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players to stand in the same positions on the court that appeared on the frozen image from Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S9</id><text>The paused clip came from an early first-half sequence in which Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had pressed down the right flank, and coach Harven Soll called out Talen Priev, Kelan Muvir, and two regular defenders by name to jog into the exact spots shown on the screen while the rest of the squad watched from the touchline.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S10</id><text>To help the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players match their spacing precisely, coach Harven Soll dropped four flat cones at their feet, adjusting each cone by a few centimeters as he compared the live positions to the frozen image of Varlen Crest Training Hall on the wall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S11</id><text>With the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players holding those positions, coach Harven Soll used a small whiteboard beside the court to sketch the same scene, labeling the first and second defender in line with the terminology from Pressing in Pairs and underlining the cue phrase \u201cstep and cover.\u201d</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S12</id><text>Coach Harven Soll used a red marker to draw the first defender and a blue marker for the second defender, adding black arrows to show the ideal shuffle path and a small shaded box to represent the central space that had been left exposed in the original action.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S13</id><text>After finishing the rough diagram, coach Harven Soll turned the whiteboard toward the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players and asked the four on-court demonstrators whether the sketched distances matched how the situation had felt in the game, prompting a brief discussion about how far the second defender should have tucked inside.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S14</id><text>In the next clip that coach Harven Soll chose from the Varlen Crest Training Hall recording, Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 had to drop out of a high press, and coach Harven Soll replayed the five-second sequence three times to emphasize the moment when the \u201creset block\u201d instruction should be called by the back line.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S15</id><text>With the volume turned up, the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players could hear that no one actually shouted \u201creset block\u201d until after Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 had already switched the ball to the far side, and coach Harven Soll paused on that frame to ask which defender should take responsibility for giving the early command.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S16</id><text>Coach Harven Soll tapped the projected image where the two deepest Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players were visible and suggested that the left-sided defender or, failing that, goalkeeper Riven Hall needed to be the designated voice in such moments so that the whole unit could drop in time.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S17</id><text>After the initial video work on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll divided Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into two groups of five players and asked each group to rehearse a slow-motion \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d walk-through from the halfway line toward a corner without a ball while coach Harven Soll counted their steps aloud.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S18</id><text>The remaining two Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players, including goalkeeper Riven Hall, initially observed from just outside the touchline before rotating into the patterns on the second and third repetitions so that every player practiced both the first and second defender roles.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S19</id><text>As each group shuffled from the halfway line toward the wall, coach Harven Soll counted \u201cone\u201d through \u201ceight\u201d in a firm voice, stopping the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 pairs if they had not reached the imagined trap line by the sixth step and nudging them a little closer together with his hands.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S20</id><text>During a later block of the 2025-08-10 session, coach Harven Soll placed Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 goalkeeper Riven Hall in front of one goal and arranged cones to represent Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 attackers so that Riven Hall could practice goal throws aimed at spaces that a coordinated \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d press would be likely to leave open.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S21</id><text>The cones in front of goalkeeper Riven Hall were set out in two staggered lines in red and yellow, mirroring the typical positions of Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17\u2019s pivot and wide players, with a clear channel left to the weak side that coach Harven Soll identified as the preferred target area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S22</id><text>In sets of a dozen repetitions, coach Harven Soll called out cues such as \u201cweak side\u201d or \u201cearly bounce,\u201d timing how quickly goalkeeper Riven Hall could collect an imaginary back-pass and deliver a firm, accurate throw into the designated corridor behind the simulated press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S23</id><text>To conclude the on-court segment on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll instructed every Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 player to select one key phrase from Pressing in Pairs, such as \u201clock line\u201d or \u201creset block,\u201d and to call out that phrase each time the player stepped into a pressing action during a final five-minute shadow pressing sequence.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S24</id><text>Some Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players chose the more descriptive cues that coach Harven Soll had written on the whiteboard earlier, shouting words like \u201cbody half-open\u201d or \u201cprotect middle\u201d as they moved, so that the court was filled with overlapping calls every time a pair slid into position.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S25</id><text>During the last minute of the shadow pressing sequence, the synchronized movements and sharp verbal cues from the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players echoed off the high ceiling, drawing a curious glance from a school caretaker wheeling a trolley past the open doorway.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S26</id><text>After the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players left the indoor court on 2025-08-10, coach Harven Soll remained at Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 to re-watch two Varlen Crest Training Hall clips on the laptop, adding detailed notes in his planning notebook that coach Harven Soll intended to share with Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 coach Deren Kavos ahead of the late-August joint review at Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S27</id><text>In his planning notebook, coach Harven Soll wrote down precise timestamps and short headings such as \u201c14:32 \u2013 late second cover, middle open\u201d and \u201c21:05 \u2013 Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17 escape via pivot rotation,\u201d underlining a few questions he wanted to ask coach Deren Kavos about Varlen Crest Futsal Club Under-17\u2019s build-out decisions.</text></item>\n<item><id>N7-S28</id><text>Coach Harven Soll finally closed the laptop and switched off the portable projector shortly before 20:00, locking the equipment cupboard at Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 and slipping the annotated notebook into his bag so that it would be ready for the upcoming joint session at Varlen Crest Training Hall.</text></item>\n</content>\n</event>\n<event>\n<date>2025-08-22</date>\n<content>\n<item><id>N8-S0</id><text>On 2025-08-22, coach Harven Soll began an after-school training session for Meadowlane

Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 started shortly after 16:05, with twelve listed players jogging in from the corridor as coach Harven Soll ticked their names off on a folded attendance sheet clipped to his clipboard.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S2</id><text>Before the warm-up on 2025-08-22, coach Harven Soll used the small court-side whiteboard to write \u201cstep and cover,\u201d \u201clock line,\u201d and \u201creset block\u201d in large letters, telling the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players that the session would be a final tune-up before the Selvarin Inter-District Schools Futsal League fixtures.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S3</id><text>Coach Harven Soll organized Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 into a series of small-sided pressing games that applied cues from the article Pressing in Pairs during the 2025-08-22 training session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S4</id><text>The small-sided pressing games on 2025-08-22 were set up as 4v4 contests plus a neutral support player on half a court, with Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 earning points for turnovers won in the attacking half within five seconds of the initial \u201cstep and cover\u201d cue.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S5</id><text>Coach Harven Soll ran each small-sided pressing round for three-minute bursts using the wall-mounted clock as a guide, rotating the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 groups between attack and defense so that every player repeatedly practiced both roles in the paired press.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S6</id><text>During one small-sided pressing game on 2025-08-22, goalkeeper Riven Hall for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 made a full-stretch dive to his right to stop a low shot near the edge of the penalty area.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S7</id><text>The shot that goalkeeper Riven Hall faced on 2025-08-22 came from a Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 teammate cutting in from the left channel, and the ball skimmed off the polished wooden floor toward the far corner before goalkeeper Riven Hall managed to tip it around the makeshift training cone being used as a goalpost.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S8</id><text>Several Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players on the sideline instinctively shouted encouragement as goalkeeper Riven Hall launched himself, with one player calling out \u201cgreat reach, Riven Hall\u201d just as goalkeeper Riven Hall slid across the court.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S9</id><text>As goalkeeper Riven Hall completed the diving save for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 on 2025-08-22, goalkeeper Riven Hall landed awkwardly on his outstretched right wrist and immediately signaled discomfort to coach Harven Soll.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S10</id><text>After the landing on 2025-08-22, goalkeeper Riven Hall rolled onto his back, pulled off his right glove with his left hand, and grimaced while cradling his wrist against his chest before calling out to coach Harven Soll that something did not feel right.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S11</id><text>Two nearby Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 defenders immediately waved toward the bench for help as goalkeeper Riven Hall remained seated on the floor near the edge of the penalty area rubbing the underside of his right wrist.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S12</id><text>Noticing the reaction of goalkeeper Riven Hall, coach Harven Soll stopped the small-sided pressing game for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 on 2025-08-22 and suspended all contact drills for the remainder of the session.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S13</id><text>Coach Harven Soll blew his whistle twice in quick succession on 2025-08-22, asked the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 players to jog slowly to the far touchline, and told the group that the rest of the training would be limited to light passing patterns and stretching while goalkeeper Riven Hall was checked.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S14</id><text>After moving goalkeeper Riven Hall carefully to a bench along the wall, coach Harven Soll made a brief note in the margin of his session plan indicating the time of the incident and circling the phrase \u201cno contact\u201d to remind himself to adjust upcoming training content.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S15</id><text>School nurse Tera Milvon from Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17\u2019s host school was called to the indoor court on 2025-08-22 and applied an ice

being called on 2025-08-22, asked goalkeeper Riven Hall to rate his pain and to move each finger, and noted mild swelling around the base of the thumb before securing the wrist with a wrap bandage.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S17</id><text>While applying the ice pack on 2025-08-22, school nurse Tera Milvon advised goalkeeper Riven Hall not to attempt any more ball work that evening and suggested that an x-ray at a local clinic would be sensible if the pain remained sharp with movement.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S18</id><text>After the on-court assessment on 2025-08-22, coach Harven Soll telephoned guardian Mara Hall of goalkeeper Riven Hall to describe the wrist injury and to recommend that goalkeeper Riven Hall be examined at a local clinic the same evening.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S19</id><text>Coach Harven Soll stepped into the quiet corridor outside the changing rooms to call guardian Mara Hall on 2025-08-22, calmly explaining the circumstances of the dive, the school nurse\u2019s initial findings, and emphasizing that goalkeeper Riven Hall had been able to walk off the court unaided.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S20</id><text>Guardian Mara Hall told coach Harven Soll during the 2025-08-22 phone call that guardian Mara Hall would pick goalkeeper Riven Hall up within about twenty minutes and drive to a nearby medical center, promising to update coach Harven Soll once a doctor had seen the injury.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S21</id><text>Concerned about early-season

a backup option.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S22</id><text>Coach Harven Soll reached student goalkeeper Jasmin Korrel by phone early on the evening of 2025-08-22, explaining that student goalkeeper Jasmin Korrel\u2019s strong performances in recent school physical education futsal blocks had marked student goalkeeper Jasmin Korrel as the most ready-made cover option.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S23</id><text>Student goalkeeper Jasmin Korrel expressed surprise but agreed during the 2025-08-22 conversation to attend the next Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 training session, asking coach Harven Soll for details on kit colors, arrival times, and any extra goalkeeper drills to expect.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S24</id><text>That night on 2025-08-22, coach Harven Soll updated the paper planning notebook for Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 by penciling goalkeeper Jasmin Korrel as a possible starter for initial fixtures in the Selvarin Inter-District Schools Futsal League if goalkeeper Riven Hall remained unavailable.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S25</id><text>Sitting at his kitchen table in the Meadowlane Quarter on 2025-08-22,

patterns\u201d in the margin.</text></item>\n<item><id>N8-S26</id><text>Coach Harven Soll also noted in the Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 planning notebook on 2025-08-22 that extra ten-minute

However, \u201cwithin roughly ten minutes\u201d excludes a 15-minute wait, so this cannot be the elapsed time for the nurse\u2019s arrival and start of treatment.",

        "scratchpad": "<scratchpad>[Sentence ID]:\nN8-S15:\n- Time information:\n  - States that school nurse Tera Milvon \u201cwas called to the indoor court \u2026 and applied an ice pack and supportive bandage to the right wrist of goalkeeper Riven Hall.\u201d\n  - The only explicit temporal anchor is the calendar date \u201con 2025-08-22\u201d.\n- Event date:\n  - This sentence is within the 2025-08-22 event; that event date is the same as the explicit date in the sentence.\nAssumptions:\n- The act of \u201cappl[ying] an ice pack and supportive bandage\u201d marks the start of the nurse\u2019s treatment of the injury.\n- The ordering is: call \u2192 arrival \u2192 assessment \u2192 application of ice pack/supportive bandage (treatment). N8-S16 supports that ordering.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Call to the nurse happens at some unknown time T_call on 2025-08-22.\n- Start of treatment (application of ice pack and supportive bandage) happens at some later time T_treat on 2025-08-22.\n\nN8-S16:\n- Time information:\n  - The nurse \u201carrived at the indoor court within roughly ten minutes of being called \u2026 before securing the wrist with a wrap bandage.\u201d\n  - Again explicitly anchored to \u201con 2025-08-22\u201d.\n- Event date:\n  - Same event and date: 2025-08-22.\nAssumptions:\n- \u201cWithin roughly ten minutes\u201d means the arrival time is between T_call and T_call + 10 minutes.\n- For the purpose of the question we can define the *maximum* possible delay consistent with that phrase as exactly 10 minutes after the call.\n- The assessment (asking about pain, moving each finger, noting swelling) takes some small, unquantified time between arrival and final securing of the bandage.\n- To get a computable duration, we additionally assume in the question that the nurse begins applying the ice pack and supportive bandage immediately upon arrival; thus T_treat = T_arrival.\nAbsolute dates:\n- T_call: unknown clock time on 2025-08-22.\n- T_arrival: in the interval (T_call, T_call + 10 minutes]; for the \u201cmaximum possible delay\u201d assumption, we set T_arrival = T_call + 10 minutes.\n- Under the extra assumption (treatment starts immediately on arrival), T_treat = T_arrival = T_call + 10 minutes.\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None needed. The two selected sentences already provide:\n  - That there was a call and that the nurse\u2019s treatment consisted of applying an ice pack and supportive bandage (N8-S15).\n  - That her arrival was within a bounded interval after the call, allowing us to derive a duration (N8-S16).\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Define a duration from:\n  - Start point: when the school nurse was called.\n  - End point: when she began applying the ice pack and supportive bandage (i.e., when treatment started).\n- N8-S16 gives a bound on the time from call to arrival (\u201cwithin roughly ten minutes\u201d).\n- N8-S15 defines what \u201cstarting treatment\u201d is (application of ice pack and supportive bandage).\n- To make the duration computable and to force use of both sentences:\n  - In the question, assume the arrival occurs at the latest time compatible with its verbal description (max delay).\n  - Also assume she starts applying the ice pack/bandage immediately on arrival.\n- The question will *not* state \u201cten minutes\u201d; instead it will refer to \u201cthe maximum delay consistent with how her arrival time is described,\u201d so the reader must look at N8-S16 to extract \u201cwithin roughly ten minutes,\u201d then reason that the maximum consistent delay is 10 minutes.\n- The question will refer specifically to \u201cbeginning to apply the ice pack and supportive bandage\u201d so N8-S15 is required to know what action marks the start of treatment and to tie that action to arrival.\n\nUniqueness / necessity of each selected sentence:\n- N8-S15:\n  - Supplies the specific treatment action (\u201capplied an ice pack and supportive bandage\u201d) and links it to the call and location.\n  - Without it, the question\u2019s reference to \u201cbeginning to apply the ice pack and supportive bandage\u201d would have no factual grounding, and the start-of-treatment moment could not be identified.\n- N8-S16:\n  - Supplies the only quantitative temporal relation: arrival occurred \u201cwithin roughly ten minutes of being called.\u201d\n  - Without it, there would be no numeric bound from which to compute the elapsed time.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Let T_call be the time the nurse is called.\n- From N8-S16: T_arrival is within \u201croughly ten minutes\u201d after T_call.\n- Under the question\u2019s explicit assumption: choose the *maximum* delay consistent with that description:\n  - T_arrival = T_call + 10 minutes.\n- Under the further assumption in the question that she begins applying the ice pack and supportive bandage immediately upon arrival:\n  - T_treat = T_arrival = T_call + 10 minutes.\n- Therefore, elapsed time from T_call to T_treat:\n  - \u0394T = T_treat \u2013 T_call = 10 minutes.</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the previous response against the task instructions:\n\n1. **Use of selected sentences and temporal info**\n   - N8-S15 provides:\n     - The fact that the nurse was *called* to the court.\n     - The specific action that defines the start of treatment: \u201capplied an ice pack and supportive bandage.\u201d\n   - N8-S16 provides:\n     - The quantitative temporal relationship: she \u201carrived at the indoor court within roughly ten minutes of being called.\u201d\n   - The question uses:\n     - The *call* as the starting time point (from both N8-S15 and N8-S16).\n     - The *beginning of applying the ice pack and supportive bandage* as the end time point (from N8-S15).\n     - The \u201cwithin roughly ten minutes\u201d phrasing to define a maximum delay (from N8-S16).\n   - Thus, **both** selected sentences are required:\n     - Without N8-S15, the treatment start (\u201capplying the ice pack and supportive bandage\u201d) is not defined.\n     - Without N8-S16, no numeric duration can be derived.\n\n2. **Need for additional sentences**\n   - No other sentences in the 2025-08-22 event provide a quantitative bound between call and treatment.\n   - No other sentence defines the specific treatment action of \u201cice pack and supportive bandage.\u201d\n   - Therefore, no additional sentence IDs are needed.\n\n3. **Question structure vs. instructions**\n   - The question:\n     - Asks for a **duration** between two time points: \u201cmoment she was called\u201d and \u201cmoment she started this treatment.\u201d\n     - Avoids explicit dates or clock times; it refers only to the narrative situation and to assumptions.\n     - Explicitly states assumptions:\n       - She arrived with the **latest delay still consistent** with \u201cwithin roughly ten minutes.\u201d\n       - She started applying the ice pack and supportive bandage **immediately upon arriving**.\n   - This forces the solver to:\n     - Extract \u201cwithin roughly ten minutes\u201d from N8-S16.\n     - Interpret \u201clatest delay consistent\u201d as exactly 10 minutes.\n     - Connect arrival to start of treatment through the assumption.\n   - The answer \u201c10 minutes\u201d is just the duration, not a full sentence, as required.\n\n4. **Temporal reasoning**\n   - Start time: T_call (when she was called).\n   - From N8-S16: arrival T_arrival \u2208 (T_call, T_call + 10 minutes], expressed as \u201cwithin roughly ten minutes.\u201d\n   - Under the question\u2019s stated assumption:\n     - T_arrival is taken as the **maximum** allowed: T_call + 10 minutes.\n     - Treatment (applying ice pack and supportive bandage) begins at arrival, so T_treat = T_arrival.\n   - Computation:\n     - \u0394T = T_treat \u2212 T_call = (T_call + 10 minutes) \u2212 T_call = 10 minutes.\n\n5. **Checking for disallowed content**\n   - No explicit dates or exact times appear in the question.\n   - The question cannot be answered from any single sentence alone; both are needed.\n   - The answer is an absolute duration in a single unit (minutes), not mixing incompatible units.\n   - The scratchpad clearly states assumptions.\n\nConclusion: The previous response already complies with the instructions. No corrections to the question or answer are needed. I will reproduce the same QA pair in the required format.\n\n</scratchpad>",
