Review the outline of previous events that have occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n4. Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to {{NUM_SPECIFIC_SENTS}} novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre ({{GENRE}}) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre {{GENRE}}. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details.

Review the outline of previous events that have occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n<event><date>2025-03-22</date><outline>The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} hosted the final day of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} on 2025-03-22. The final day program at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final. {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} entered the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} as the qualifying representative team of the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} of {Selvarin City|LOCATION-2}. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} had secured the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign. The squad of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won all three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} to finish first in {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}. In {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} recorded a 3\u20130 win over {Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17|ORGANIZATION-4}, a 2\u20131 victory against {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5}, and a 1\u20130 result over {Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17|ORGANIZATION-6}. The group-stage fixtures for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} were played over three consecutive evenings at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The lone group-stage goal against {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward {Laren Vos|PERSON-1} of {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5} late in the first half of their second group match. Goalkeeper {Ren Talvek|PERSON-2} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} defeated {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. In the semifinal, winger {Daren Mol|PERSON-3} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot {Jorin Kale|PERSON-4} netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine. The semifinal between {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} and {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} was officiated by referee {Elvin Sarro|PERSON-5} and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches. The 2\u20131 semifinal victory over {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} gave {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a second goal conceded in the entire {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} restored the lead. Despite the setback, the defensive unit of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} responded by limiting {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won the final of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} with a 3\u20130 victory over {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}. The final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} captain and playmaker {Mikel Ardan|PERSON-6} scoring twice and flank player {Sera Noll|PERSON-7} adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages. {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves. With five wins from five matches, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} secured the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} title while conceding only two goals in the tournament. Across the five matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} scored a total of 11 goals, finishing with the best goal difference of any team in the competition. Several school coaches and spectators at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} remarked that the consistency shown by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} across all phases of play set a benchmark for future editions of the under-17 event. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} credited the championship success of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} media team. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8}, who has led youth teams at {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy|ORGANIZATION-3} for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills. During the interview conducted courtside by council media officer {Lina Veress|PERSON-9}, head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period. The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} awarded {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a development grant for new training equipment in recognition of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} victory by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. The development grant from the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} was announced as a package valued at approximately 3,000 {selvars|MISCELLANEOUS-1}, earmarked for purchasing new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility training gear for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. Representatives of the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} handed the official grant confirmation letter to head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} at the edge of the main court, with the players of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} gathered around in team tracksuits.</outline></event>\n</history>\n\n4. Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: 2025-06-30\n<outline>\nIn early June 2025, editor Ralen Ko of the regional magazine Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly commissioned sports communications officer Lina Veress to write a print feature series on the title run of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.\nOn 2025-06-18, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granted Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly permission to reproduce selected statistics and photographs from the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship in the feature series authored by Lina Veress.\nIn preparation for the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series, Lina Veress conducted extended interviews with head coach Marlen Tiravo of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 focusing on training structure, team culture, and the weeks leading up to the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.\nSelvarin Youth Sport Quarterly staff used match footage from Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center to create tactical diagrams and sequence illustrations that visually supported the written analysis by Lina Veress of the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 performances.\nOn the morning of 2025-06-30, Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly released its mid-year print issue featuring a multi-part analytical series by Lina Veress on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 campaign at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.\nWithin the 2025-06-30 issue of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly, an article titled \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress detailed a recurring defensive pattern used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship and translated it into step-by-step drills for youth coaches.\nOn the afternoon of 2025-06-30, head coach Marlen Tiravo held a classroom-style review session at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy training facility where Marlen Tiravo distributed copies of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series by Lina Veress to the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.\nBy the evening of 2025-06-30, several school futsal coaches in Selvarin City, including Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach Harven Soll, reported using the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly articles by Lina Veress as practical reference material for planning upcoming youth training sessions.\nIn a brief comment published alongside the feature series on 2025-06-30, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council development coordinator Neris Dalvo stated that Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council did not plan to produce separate official school case-study booklets about the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 title run.\nDespite the absence of dedicated case-study materials from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, local coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone and broader Selvarin City began informally treating the series by Lina Veress in Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly as a de facto reference document for youth futsal training discussions.\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to 2 novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre (Sports) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre Sports. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details.

      "<event><date>2025-03-22</date><outline>The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} hosted the final day of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} on 2025-03-22. The final day program at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final. {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} entered the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} as the qualifying representative team of the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} of {Selvarin City|LOCATION-2}. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} had secured the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign. The squad of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won all three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} to finish first in {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}. In {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} recorded a 3\u20130 win over {Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17|ORGANIZATION-4}, a 2\u20131 victory against {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5}, and a 1\u20130 result over {Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17|ORGANIZATION-6}. The group-stage fixtures for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} were played over three consecutive evenings at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The lone group-stage goal against {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward {Laren Vos|PERSON-1} of {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5} late in the first half of their second group match. Goalkeeper {Ren Talvek|PERSON-2} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} defeated {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. In the semifinal, winger {Daren Mol|PERSON-3} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot {Jorin Kale|PERSON-4} netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine. The semifinal between {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} and {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} was officiated by referee {Elvin Sarro|PERSON-5} and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches. The 2\u20131 semifinal victory over {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} gave {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a second goal conceded in the entire {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} restored the lead. Despite the setback, the defensive unit of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} responded by limiting {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won the final of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} with a 3\u20130 victory over {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}. The final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} captain and playmaker {Mikel Ardan|PERSON-6} scoring twice and flank player {Sera Noll|PERSON-7} adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages. {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves. With five wins from five matches, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} secured the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} title while conceding only two goals in the tournament. Across the five matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} scored a total of 11 goals, finishing with the best goal difference of any team in the competition. Several school coaches and spectators at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} remarked that the consistency shown by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} across all phases of play set a benchmark for future editions of the under-17 event. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} credited the championship success of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} media team. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8}, who has led youth teams at {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy|ORGANIZATION-3} for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills. During the interview conducted courtside by council media officer {Lina Veress|PERSON-9}, head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period.

The development grant from the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} was announced as a package valued at approximately 3,000 {selvars|MISCELLANEOUS-1}, earmarked for purchasing new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility training gear for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. Representatives of the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} handed the official grant confirmation letter to head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} at the edge of the main court, with the players of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} gathered around in team tracksuits.</outline></event>"

The final day program at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final. {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} entered the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} as the qualifying representative team of the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} of {Selvarin City|LOCATION-2}. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} had secured the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign. The squad of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won all three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} to finish first in {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}. In {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} recorded a 3\u20130 win over {Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17|ORGANIZATION-4}, a 2\u20131 victory against {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5}, and a 1\u20130 result over {Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17|ORGANIZATION-6}. The group-stage fixtures for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} were played over three consecutive evenings at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The lone group-stage goal against {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward {Laren Vos|PERSON-1} of {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5} late in the first half of their second group match. Goalkeeper {Ren Talvek|PERSON-2} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} defeated {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. In the semifinal, winger {Daren Mol|PERSON-3} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot {Jorin Kale|PERSON-4} netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine. The semifinal between {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} and {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} was officiated by referee {Elvin Sarro|PERSON-5} and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches. The 2\u20131 semifinal victory over {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} gave {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a second goal conceded in the entire {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} restored the lead. Despite the setback, the defensive unit of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} responded by limiting {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won the final of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} with a 3\u20130 victory over {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}. The final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} captain and playmaker {Mikel Ardan|PERSON-6} scoring twice and flank player {Sera Noll|PERSON-7} adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages. {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves. With five wins from five matches, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} secured the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} title while conceding only two goals in the tournament. Across the five matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} scored a total of 11 goals, finishing with the best goal difference of any team in the competition. Several school coaches and spectators at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} remarked that the consistency shown by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} across all phases of play set a benchmark for future editions of the under-17 event. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} credited the championship success of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} media team. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8}, who has led youth teams at {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy|ORGANIZATION-3} for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills. During the interview conducted courtside by council media officer {Lina Veress|PERSON-9}, head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period. The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} awarded {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a development grant for new training equipment in recognition of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} victory by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. The development grant from the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} was announced as a package valued at approximately 3,000 {selvars|MISCELLANEOUS-1}, earmarked for purchasing new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility training gear for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. Representatives of the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} handed the official grant confirmation letter to head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} at the edge of the main court, with the players of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} gathered around in team tracksuits.</outline></event>",
