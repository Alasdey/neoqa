    "response": "<results>\n<scratchpad>\nI checked the new outline against the established entities and prior history.\n\nKey prior facts:\n- Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 won the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship, going 5\u20130, conceding 2 goals, scoring 11.\n- The tournament ran 2025-03-15 to 2025-03-22 at Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center.\n- Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council organized the event and has a small staff.\n- Lina Veress is a sports communications officer and freelance journalist who conducted the post-final courtside interview with head coach Marlen Tiravo on behalf of the council media team.\n- Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 used a compact 2\u20132 defensive shape in the final.\n- Grendale Youth Futsal Academy and its U-17 squad are based in Grendale Suburban Zone, associated with Selvarin City.\n- Selvars are the currency.\n\nChecks performed:\n\n1. Timeline consistency\n- The new outline is set in early June 2025 and on 2025-06-18 and 2025-06-30, which is appropriately after the March 2025 championship.\n- The internal deadlines (draft by 2025-06-20, issue release on 2025-06-30) are plausible.\n- Permissions from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council on 2025-06-18 logically precede publication.\n\n2. Use of existing entities and past events\n- \u201cTitle run of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship\u201d is consistent with their documented championship victory.\n- Reference to the \u201ccourtside interview\u201d by Lina Veress with head coach Marlen Tiravo after the final matches the prior history exactly.\n- Mention that the team used a compact 2\u20132 defensive shape in analysis diagrams aligns with the final\u2019s tactical description in the history.\n- A Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 review session involving \u201caround a dozen players\u201d is consistent with the earlier note that 12 players were registered.\n- Distribution of the magazine to Selvarin City and Grendale Suburban Zone matches the locations and their relationship (\u201cGrendale Suburban Zone of Selvarin City\u201d).\n- Use of \u201cselvars\u201d as the cover price currency is consistent with selvars being Kerevalia\u2019s currency and with prior budget/grant references.\n\n3. New entities introduced\nThe outline introduces several new people and an organization not previously listed:\n- Editor Ralen Ko\n- Magazine Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly (a regional magazine)\n- Chairperson Doran Helv (of Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council)\n- Graphic designer Hele Narm\n- Development coordinator Neris Dalvo (of Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council)\n- Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17\n\nNone of these conflict with existing data; the council having a chairperson and a development coordinator is compatible with its small staff size and activities. Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly as an independent regional magazine is plausible and does not contradict anything.\n\n4. Permissions and usage conditions\n- Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granting permission for reproduction of statistics and photographs and stipulating \u201cnon-elite youth futsal education\u201d use is consistent with its mission to promote youth futsal and with them controlling an archive of media and statistics.\n- The magazine\u2019s use (educational articles and drills for youth coaches/players) falls under that category, so there is no contradiction.\n\n5. Internal consistency of the new outline\n- Repeated use of \u201cSelvarin Youth Sport Quarterly\u201d is consistent in spelling and form.\n- Tactical content (pressing in pairs, transition diagrams, 2\u20132 block to counter-attacks) builds directly on previously described playing style, not contradicting any match facts.\n- The number and nature of diagrams, pages, print run, and pricing are all plausible and do not intersect with any constraints from the earlier history.\n- The council\u2019s statement that it does not plan separate official case-study booklets does not conflict with any prior commitment.\n\nI did not find any logical or factual contradictions between the outline and the established entities/history. All cross-references to known people, organizations, events, the venue, and tactics are consistent. The only minor technical issue in the user\u2019s XML was the final `<storyitems>` tag being unclosed, but that is formatting rather than a story inconsistency; I correct it by closing the tag in the required output format.\n\nTherefore, no content changes to the story items are necessary; I reproduce them as given.\n</scratchpad>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>In early June 2025, editor Ralen Ko of the regional magazine Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly commissioned sports communications officer Lina Veress to write a print feature series on the title run of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>During a planning meeting at the modest Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly office near the eastern tram loop in Selvarin City, editor Ralen Ko outlined a three-part, 10\u201312 page series and asked Lina Veress to submit a first draft by 2025-06-20 to meet the mid-year print deadline.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Editor Ralen Ko specifically cited the composed courtside interview that Lina Veress had conducted with head coach Marlen Tiravo after the final as a key reason for assigning the feature, believing that Lina Veress could balance tactical detail with human-interest storytelling for a youth audience.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>On 2025-06-18, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granted Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly permission to reproduce selected statistics and photographs from the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship in the feature series authored by Lina Veress.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The permission was confirmed in a two-page email agreement signed off by Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council chairperson Doran Helv, stipulating that all images be credit-lined to the council archive and used only in connection with non-elite youth futsal education.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Along with the written approval, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council provided Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly with a folder of 24 high-resolution action photographs and the official match-statistics spreadsheets for all five fixtures played by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>In preparation for the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series, Lina Veress conducted extended interviews with head coach Marlen Tiravo of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 focusing on training structure, team culture, and the weeks leading up to the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The interviews consisted of two evening video calls and one in-person conversation at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy office, each lasting around 70 to 90 minutes, with head coach Marlen Tiravo bringing along a binder of weekly training schedules from January to March 2025.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>During these discussions, head coach Marlen Tiravo described specific routines such as Monday small-sided pressing games and Thursday match-simulation blocks, and emphasized to Lina Veress how player-led feedback circles on Fridays had helped shape the squad\u2019s sense of collective responsibility.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly staff used match footage from Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center to create tactical diagrams and sequence illustrations that visually supported the written analysis by Lina Veress of the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 performances.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The magazine\u2019s two-person analysis team replayed key passages from the semifinal and final on a large screen in their editing room, manually logging pressing triggers, passing lanes, and player rotations that could be translated into simplified diagrams for young readers.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Graphic designer Hele Narm transformed these notes into four full-page diagrams and several smaller in-text sequences, using colored arrows and numbered frames to show how Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 shifted from a compact 2\u20132 block into coordinated counter-attacks.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>On the morning of 2025-06-30, Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly released its mid-year print issue featuring a multi-part analytical series by Lina Veress on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 campaign at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The issue, Volume 13 Number 2, had a print run of approximately 2,500 copies and was distributed to secondary schools, community sports halls, and neighborhood kiosks across Selvarin City and the Grendale Suburban Zone at a cover price of 8 selvars.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The front cover of the mid-year issue featured a full-width photograph of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 captain Mikel Ardan lifting the championship trophy, with a headline banner reading \u201cHow Grendale Built a Champion Team.\u201d</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Within the 2025-06-30 issue of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly, an article titled \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress detailed a recurring defensive pattern used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship and translated it into step-by-step drills for youth coaches.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d piece filled four magazine pages and broke the concept into three progressive training blocks, each specifying recommended pitch dimensions, work-to-rest ratios, and suggested adaptations for under-13, under-15, and under-17 age groups.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>A highlighted sidebar within the article quoted head coach Marlen Tiravo explaining how a simple verbal cue of \u201cstep and cover\u201d helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players coordinate their movements when initiating the paired press in competitive matches.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>On the afternoon of 2025-06-30, head coach Marlen Tiravo held a classroom-style review session at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy training facility where Marlen Tiravo distributed copies of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series by Lina Veress to the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The review session took place in a small upstairs meeting room overlooking the indoor training court, with around a dozen players seated at desks while head coach Marlen Tiravo used a whiteboard and a projector to walk through key diagrams from the magazine.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Head coach Marlen Tiravo asked each player of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to highlight at least one paragraph that reflected their own habits, leading to a brief discussion in which several players expressed surprise at seeing their off-the-ball work described in print.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>By the evening of 2025-06-30, several school futsal coaches in Selvarin City, including Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach Harven Soll, reported using the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly articles by Lina Veress as practical reference material for planning upcoming youth training sessions.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 marked specific drills from \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d with sticky notes in his planning notebook and penciled them into his July pre-season schedule as alternatives to his standard defensive warm-up routines.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Other coaches in Selvarin City mentioned in informal messages to editor Ralen Ko that they appreciated the clear field diagrams and ready-made session plans, which allowed them to adapt Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 concepts without having to design exercises from scratch.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>In a brief comment published alongside the feature series on 2025-06-30, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council development coordinator Neris Dalvo stated that Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council did not plan to produce separate official school case-study booklets about the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 title run.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The note from development coordinator Neris Dalvo appeared in a shaded \u201cCouncil Perspective\u201d box at the bottom of the first feature page, where Neris Dalvo cited limited staff capacity and a preference for issuing broader coaching guidelines rather than detailed profiles of single teams.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>In the same comment, development coordinator Neris Dalvo nevertheless thanked Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 for setting \u201ca positive standard for preparation and sportsmanship\u201d and expressed support for independent publications that highlighted constructive youth coaching practices.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Despite the absence of dedicated case-study materials from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, local coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone and broader Selvarin City began informally treating the series by Lina Veress in Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly as a de facto reference document for youth futsal training discussions.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>During informal planning conversations and email exchanges on 2025-06-30, several coaches referred to specific pages of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly issue\u2014such as the transition-attack diagram on page 11\u2014as shorthand examples when debating how aggressively to press with teenage players.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Some coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone scanned or photographed selected layouts from the feature series and shared them within small staff groups, using the material as a common visual basis for adjusting their own session content rather than as any kind of official curriculum.</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>"

A history of fictional events involving these entities:\n<history>\n<event><date>2025-03-22</date><outline>The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} hosted the final day of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} on 2025-03-22. The final day program at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final. {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} entered the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} as the qualifying representative team of the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} of {Selvarin City|LOCATION-2}. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} had secured the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign. The squad of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won all three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} to finish first in {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}. In {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} recorded a 3\u20130 win over {Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17|ORGANIZATION-4}, a 2\u20131 victory against {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5}, and a 1\u20130 result over {Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17|ORGANIZATION-6}. The group-stage fixtures for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} were played over three consecutive evenings at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The lone group-stage goal against {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward {Laren Vos|PERSON-1} of {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5} late in the first half of their second group match. Goalkeeper {Ren Talvek|PERSON-2} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} defeated {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. In the semifinal, winger {Daren Mol|PERSON-3} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot {Jorin Kale|PERSON-4} netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine. The semifinal between {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} and {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} was officiated by referee {Elvin Sarro|PERSON-5} and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches. The 2\u20131 semifinal victory over {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} gave {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a second goal conceded in the entire {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} restored the lead. Despite the setback, the defensive unit of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} responded by limiting {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won the final of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} with a 3\u20130 victory over {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}. The final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} captain and playmaker {Mikel Ardan|PERSON-6} scoring twice and flank player {Sera Noll|PERSON-7} adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages. {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves. With five wins from five matches, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} secured the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} title while conceding only two goals in the tournament. Across the five matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} scored a total of 11 goals, finishing with the best goal difference of any team in the competition. Several school coaches and spectators at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} remarked that the consistency shown by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} across all phases of play set a benchmark for future editions of the under-17 event. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} credited the championship success of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} media team. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8}, who has led youth teams at {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy|ORGANIZATION-3} for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills. During the interview conducted courtside by council media officer {Lina Veress|PERSON-9}, head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period. The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} awarded {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a development grant for new training equipment in recognition of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} victory by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. The development grant from the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} was announced as a package valued at approximately 3,000 {selvars|MISCELLANEOUS-1}, earmarked for purchasing new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility training gear for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. Representatives of the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} handed the official grant confirmation letter to head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} at the edge of the main court, with the players of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} gathered around in team tracksuits.</outline></event>\n</history>\n\n3.

youth futsal education.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Along with the written approval, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council provided Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly with a folder of 24 high-resolution action photographs and the official match-statistics spreadsheets for all five fixtures played by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>In preparation for the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series, Lina Veress conducted extended interviews with head coach Marlen Tiravo of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 focusing on training structure, team culture, and the weeks leading up to the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The interviews consisted of two evening video calls and one in-person conversation at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy office, each lasting around 70 to 90 minutes, with head coach Marlen Tiravo bringing along a binder of weekly training schedules from January to March 2025.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>During these discussions, head coach Marlen Tiravo described specific routines such as Monday small-sided pressing games and Thursday match-simulation blocks, and emphasized to Lina Veress how player-led feedback circles on Fridays had helped shape the squad\u2019s sense of collective responsibility.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly staff used match footage from Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center to create tactical diagrams and sequence illustrations that visually supported the written analysis by Lina Veress of the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 performances.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The magazine\u2019s two-person analysis team replayed key passages from the semifinal and final on a large screen in their editing room, manually logging pressing triggers, passing lanes, and player rotations that could be translated into simplified diagrams for young readers.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Graphic designer Hele Narm transformed these notes into four full-page diagrams and several smaller in-text sequences, using colored arrows and numbered frames to show how Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 shifted from a compact 2\u20132 block into coordinated counter-attacks.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>On the morning of 2025-06-30, Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly released its mid-year print issue featuring a multi-part analytical series by Lina Veress on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 campaign at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The issue, Volume 13 Number 2, had a print run of approximately 2,500 copies and was distributed to secondary schools, community sports halls, and neighborhood kiosks across Selvarin City and the Grendale Suburban Zone at a cover price of 8 selvars.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The front cover of the mid-year issue featured a full-width photograph of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 captain Mikel Ardan lifting the championship trophy, with a headline banner reading \u201cHow Grendale Built a Champion Team.\u201d</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Within the 2025-06-30 issue of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly, an article titled \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress detailed a recurring defensive pattern used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship and translated it into step-by-step drills for youth coaches.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d piece filled four magazine pages and broke the concept into three progressive training blocks, each specifying recommended pitch dimensions, work-to-rest ratios, and suggested adaptations for under-13, under-15, and under-17 age groups.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>A highlighted sidebar within the article quoted head coach Marlen Tiravo explaining how a simple verbal cue of \u201cstep and cover\u201d helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players coordinate their movements when initiating the paired press in competitive matches.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>On the afternoon of 2025-06-30, head coach Marlen Tiravo held a classroom-style review session at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy training facility where Marlen Tiravo distributed copies of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series by Lina Veress to the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The review session took place in a small upstairs meeting room overlooking the indoor training court, with around a dozen players seated at desks while head coach Marlen Tiravo used a whiteboard and a projector to walk through key diagrams from the magazine.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Head coach Marlen Tiravo asked each player of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to highlight at least one paragraph that reflected their own habits, leading to a brief discussion in which several players expressed surprise at seeing their off-the-ball work described in print.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>By the evening of 2025-06-30, several school futsal coaches in Selvarin City, including Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach Harven Soll, reported using the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly articles by Lina Veress as practical reference material for planning upcoming youth training sessions.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 marked specific drills from \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d with sticky notes in his planning notebook and penciled them into his July pre-season schedule as alternatives to his standard defensive warm-up routines.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Other coaches in Selvarin City mentioned in informal messages to editor Ralen Ko that they appreciated the clear field diagrams and ready-made session plans, which allowed them to adapt Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 concepts without having to design exercises from scratch.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>In a brief comment published alongside the feature series on 2025-06-30, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council development coordinator Neris Dalvo stated that Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council did not plan to produce separate official school case-study booklets about the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 title run.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The note from development coordinator Neris Dalvo appeared in a shaded \u201cCouncil Perspective\u201d box at the bottom of the first feature page, where Neris Dalvo cited limited staff capacity and a preference for issuing broader coaching guidelines rather than detailed profiles of single teams.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>In the same comment, development coordinator Neris Dalvo nevertheless thanked Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 for setting \u201ca positive standard for preparation and sportsmanship\u201d and expressed support for independent publications that highlighted constructive youth coaching practices.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Despite the absence of dedicated case-study materials from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, local coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone and broader Selvarin City began informally treating the series by Lina Veress in Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly as a de facto reference document for youth futsal training discussions.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>During informal planning conversations and email exchanges on 2025-06-30, several coaches referred to specific pages of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly issue\u2014such as the transition-attack diagram on page 11\u2014as shorthand examples when debating how aggressively to press with teenage players.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Some coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone scanned or photographed selected layouts from the feature series and shared them within small staff groups, using the material as a common visual basis for adjusting their own session content rather than as any kind of official curriculum.</storyitem>\n<storyitems>\n</outline>\n\nFollow

      "<event><date>2025-03-22</date><outline>The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} hosted the final day of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} on 2025-03-22. The final day program at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final. {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} entered the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} as the qualifying representative team of the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} of {Selvarin City|LOCATION-2}. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} had secured the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign. The squad of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won all three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} to finish first in {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}. In {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} recorded a 3\u20130 win over {Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17|ORGANIZATION-4}, a 2\u20131 victory against {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5}, and a 1\u20130 result over {Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17|ORGANIZATION-6}. The group-stage fixtures for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} were played over three consecutive evenings at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The lone group-stage goal against {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward {Laren Vos|PERSON-1} of {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5} late in the first half of their second group match. Goalkeeper {Ren Talvek|PERSON-2} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} defeated {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. In the semifinal, winger {Daren Mol|PERSON-3} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot {Jorin Kale|PERSON-4} netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine. The semifinal between {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} and {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} was officiated by referee {Elvin Sarro|PERSON-5} and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches. The 2\u20131 semifinal victory over {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} gave {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a second goal conceded in the entire {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} restored the lead. Despite the setback, the defensive unit of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} responded by limiting {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won the final of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} with a 3\u20130 victory over {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}. The final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} captain and playmaker {Mikel Ardan|PERSON-6} scoring twice and flank player {Sera Noll|PERSON-7} adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages. {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves. With five wins from five matches, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} secured the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} title while conceding only two goals in the tournament. Across the five matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} scored a total of 11 goals, finishing with the best goal difference of any team in the competition. Several school coaches and spectators at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} remarked that the consistency shown by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} across all phases of play set a benchmark for future editions of the under-17 event. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} credited the championship success of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} media team. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8}, who has led youth teams at {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy|ORGANIZATION-3} for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills. During the interview conducted courtside by council media officer {Lina Veress|PERSON-9}, head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period. The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} awarded {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a development grant for new training equipment in recognition of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} victory by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. The development grant from the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} was announced as a package valued at approximately 3,000 {selvars|MISCELLANEOUS-1}, earmarked for purchasing new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility training gear for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. Representatives of the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} handed the official grant confirmation letter to head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} at the edge of the main court, with the players of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} gathered around in team tracksuits.</outline></event>"

The final day program at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final. {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} entered the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} as the qualifying representative team of the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} of {Selvarin City|LOCATION-2}. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} had secured the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign. The squad of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won all three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} to finish first in {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}. In {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} recorded a 3\u20130 win over {Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17|ORGANIZATION-4}, a 2\u20131 victory against {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5}, and a 1\u20130 result over {Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17|ORGANIZATION-6}. The group-stage fixtures for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} were played over three consecutive evenings at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The lone group-stage goal against {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward {Laren Vos|PERSON-1} of {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5} late in the first half of their second group match. Goalkeeper {Ren Talvek|PERSON-2} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} defeated {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. In the semifinal, winger {Daren Mol|PERSON-3} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot {Jorin Kale|PERSON-4} netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine. The semifinal between {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} and {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} was officiated by referee {Elvin Sarro|PERSON-5} and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches. The 2\u20131 semifinal victory over {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} gave {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a second goal conceded in the entire {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} restored the lead. Despite the setback, the defensive unit of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} responded by limiting {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won the final of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} with a 3\u20130 victory over {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}. The final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} captain and playmaker {Mikel Ardan|PERSON-6} scoring twice and flank player {Sera Noll|PERSON-7} adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages. {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves. With five wins from five matches, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} secured the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} title while conceding only two goals in the tournament. Across the five matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} scored a total of 11 goals, finishing with the best goal difference of any team in the competition. Several school coaches and spectators at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} remarked that the consistency shown by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} across all phases of play set a benchmark for future editions of the under-17 event. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} credited the championship success of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} media team. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8}, who has led youth teams at {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy|ORGANIZATION-3} for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills. During the interview conducted courtside by council media officer {Lina Veress|PERSON-9}, head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period.

      "In early June 2025, editor Ralen Ko of the regional magazine Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly commissioned sports communications officer Lina Veress to write a print feature series on the title run of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.",
      "During a planning meeting at the modest Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly office near the eastern tram loop in Selvarin City, editor Ralen Ko outlined a three-part, 10\u201312 page series and asked Lina Veress to submit a first draft by 2025-06-20 to meet the mid-year print deadline.",
      "Editor Ralen Ko specifically cited the composed courtside interview that Lina Veress had conducted with head coach Marlen Tiravo after the final as a key reason for assigning the feature, believing that Lina Veress could balance tactical detail with human-interest storytelling for a youth audience.",
      "On 2025-06-18, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granted Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly permission to reproduce selected statistics and photographs from the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship in the feature series authored by Lina Veress.",
      "The permission was confirmed in a two-page email agreement signed off by Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council chairperson Doran Helv, stipulating that all images be credit-lined to the council archive and used only in connection with non-elite youth futsal education.",
      "Along with the written approval, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council provided Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly with a folder of 24 high-resolution action photographs and the official match-statistics spreadsheets for all five fixtures played by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.",
      "In preparation for the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series, Lina Veress conducted extended interviews with head coach Marlen Tiravo of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 focusing on training structure, team culture, and the weeks leading up to the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.",
      "The interviews consisted of two evening video calls and one in-person conversation at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy office, each lasting around 70 to 90 minutes, with head coach Marlen Tiravo bringing along a binder of weekly training schedules from January to March 2025.",
      "During these discussions, head coach Marlen Tiravo described specific routines such as Monday small-sided pressing games and Thursday match-simulation blocks, and emphasized to Lina Veress how player-led feedback circles on Fridays had helped shape the squad\u2019s sense of collective responsibility.",
      "Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly staff used match footage from Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center to create tactical diagrams and sequence illustrations that visually supported the written analysis by Lina Veress of the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 performances.",
      "The magazine\u2019s two-person analysis team replayed key passages from the semifinal and final on a large screen in their editing room, manually logging pressing triggers, passing lanes, and player rotations that could be translated into simplified diagrams for young readers.",
      "Graphic designer Hele Narm transformed these notes into four full-page diagrams and several smaller in-text sequences, using colored arrows and numbered frames to show how Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 shifted from a compact 2\u20132 block into coordinated counter-attacks.",
      "On the morning of 2025-06-30, Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly released its mid-year print issue featuring a multi-part analytical series by Lina Veress on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 campaign at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.",
      "The issue, Volume 13 Number 2, had a print run of approximately 2,500 copies and was distributed to secondary schools, community sports halls, and neighborhood kiosks across Selvarin City and the Grendale Suburban Zone at a cover price of 8 selvars.",
      "The front cover of the mid-year issue featured a full-width photograph of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 captain Mikel Ardan lifting the championship trophy, with a headline banner reading \u201cHow Grendale Built a Champion Team.\u201d",
      "Within the 2025-06-30 issue of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly, an article titled \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress detailed a recurring defensive pattern used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship and translated it into step-by-step drills for youth coaches.",
      "The \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d piece filled four magazine pages and broke the concept into three progressive training blocks, each specifying recommended pitch dimensions, work-to-rest ratios, and suggested adaptations for under-13, under-15, and under-17 age groups.",
      "A highlighted sidebar within the article quoted head coach Marlen Tiravo explaining how a simple verbal cue of \u201cstep and cover\u201d helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players coordinate their movements when initiating the paired press in competitive matches.",
      "On the afternoon of 2025-06-30, head coach Marlen Tiravo held a classroom-style review session at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy training facility where Marlen Tiravo distributed copies of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series by Lina Veress to the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.",
      "The review session took place in a small upstairs meeting room overlooking the indoor training court, with around a dozen players seated at desks while head coach Marlen Tiravo used a whiteboard and a projector to walk through key diagrams from the magazine.",
      "Head coach Marlen Tiravo asked each player of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to highlight at least one paragraph that reflected their own habits, leading to a brief discussion in which several players expressed surprise at seeing their off-the-ball work described in print.",
      "By the evening of 2025-06-30, several school futsal coaches in Selvarin City, including Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach Harven Soll, reported using the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly articles by Lina Veress as practical reference material for planning upcoming youth training sessions.",
      "Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 marked specific drills from \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d with sticky notes in his planning notebook and penciled them into his July pre-season schedule as alternatives to his standard defensive warm-up routines.",
      "Other coaches in Selvarin City mentioned in informal messages to editor Ralen Ko that they appreciated the clear field diagrams and ready-made session plans, which allowed them to adapt Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 concepts without having to design exercises from scratch.",
      "In a brief comment published alongside the feature series on 2025-06-30, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council development coordinator Neris Dalvo stated that Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council did not plan to produce separate official school case-study booklets about the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 title run.",
      "The note from development coordinator Neris Dalvo appeared in a shaded \u201cCouncil Perspective\u201d box at the bottom of the first feature page, where Neris Dalvo cited limited staff capacity and a preference for issuing broader coaching guidelines rather than detailed profiles of single teams.",
      "In the same comment, development coordinator Neris Dalvo nevertheless thanked Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 for setting \u201ca positive standard for preparation and sportsmanship\u201d and expressed support for independent publications that highlighted constructive youth coaching practices.",
      "Despite the absence of dedicated case-study materials from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, local coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone and broader Selvarin City began informally treating the series by Lina Veress in Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly as a de facto reference document for youth futsal training discussions.",

      "Some coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone scanned or photographed selected layouts from the feature series and shared them within small staff groups, using the material as a common visual basis for adjusting their own session content rather than as any kind of official curriculum."
