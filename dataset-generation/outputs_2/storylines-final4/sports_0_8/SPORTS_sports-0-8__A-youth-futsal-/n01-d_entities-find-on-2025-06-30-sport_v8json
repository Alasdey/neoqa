  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying new named entities from a given outline of a fictional event description. Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<OUTLINE>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures. Note that these lists may be empty or contain partial information:\n\n<entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</entities>\n\nThe definitions with examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural landmarks, and regions.\nExamples: Paris, Mount Everest, California, Amazon Rainforest, Japan, Australia, Australian\n\n- Product\nDefinition: Goods or services created for consumer use or commercial purposes.\nExamples: iPhone, Coca-Cola, Microsoft Office, Tesla Model 3\n\n- Art\nDefinition: Creative works in various forms, including artifacts, ornaments, visual arts, literature, music, and performance.\nExamples: Mona Lisa, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Hamilton (musical)\n\n - Building\nDefinition: Structures designed for human occupancy or use, including residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity. However, this phrase contains the named entity Chicago (location)\n\nExample: \"I bought tickets to go on the Sky Needle, the highest skyscraper in town!\"\n- \"Sky Needle\" is a named entity (building)\n\nExample: \"Aboriginal people from a well known Australian city.\"\n- \"Aboriginal\" is a named entity (Organization)\n- \"Australia\" is a named entity (Location)\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",
  "text_prompt": "You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying new named entities from a given outline of a fictional event description. Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: 2025-06-30\n<OUTLINE>\nIn early June 2025, editor Ralen Ko of the regional magazine Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly commissioned sports communications officer Lina Veress to write a print feature series on the title run of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.\nDuring a planning meeting at the modest Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly office near the eastern tram loop in Selvarin City, editor Ralen Ko outlined a three-part, 10\u201312 page series and asked Lina Veress to submit a first draft by 2025-06-20 to meet the mid-year print deadline.\nEditor Ralen Ko specifically cited the composed courtside interview that Lina Veress had conducted with head coach Marlen Tiravo after the final as a key reason for assigning the feature, believing that Lina Veress could balance tactical detail with human-interest storytelling for a youth audience.\nOn 2025-06-18, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granted Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly permission to reproduce selected statistics and photographs from the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship in the feature series authored by Lina Veress.\nThe permission was confirmed in a two-page email agreement signed off by Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council chairperson Doran Helv, stipulating that all images be credit-lined to the council archive and used only in connection with non-elite youth futsal education.\nAlong with the written approval, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council provided Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly with a folder of 24 high-resolution action photographs and the official match-statistics spreadsheets for all five fixtures played by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.\nIn preparation for the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series, Lina Veress conducted extended interviews with head coach Marlen Tiravo of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 focusing on training structure, team culture, and the weeks leading up to the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.\nThe interviews consisted of two evening video calls and one in-person conversation at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy office, each lasting around 70 to 90 minutes, with head coach Marlen Tiravo bringing along a binder of weekly training schedules from January to March 2025.\nDuring these discussions, head coach Marlen Tiravo described specific routines such as Monday small-sided pressing games and Thursday match-simulation blocks, and emphasized to Lina Veress how player-led feedback circles on Fridays had helped shape the squad\u2019s sense of collective responsibility.\nSelvarin Youth Sport Quarterly staff used match footage from Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center to create tactical diagrams and sequence illustrations that visually supported the written analysis by Lina Veress of the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 performances.\nThe magazine\u2019s two-person analysis team replayed key passages from the semifinal and final on a large screen in their editing room, manually logging pressing triggers, passing lanes, and player rotations that could be translated into simplified diagrams for young readers.\nGraphic designer Hele Narm transformed these notes into four full-page diagrams and several smaller in-text sequences, using colored arrows and numbered frames to show how Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 shifted from a compact 2\u20132 block into coordinated counter-attacks.\nOn the morning of 2025-06-30, Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly released its mid-year print issue featuring a multi-part analytical series by Lina Veress on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 campaign at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.\nThe issue, Volume 13 Number 2, had a print run of approximately 2,500 copies and was distributed to secondary schools, community sports halls, and neighborhood kiosks across Selvarin City and the Grendale Suburban Zone at a cover price of 8 selvars.\nThe front cover of the mid-year issue featured a full-width photograph of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 captain Mikel Ardan lifting the championship trophy, with a headline banner reading \u201cHow Grendale Built a Champion Team.\u201d\nWithin the 2025-06-30 issue of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly, an article titled \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress detailed a recurring defensive pattern used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship and translated it into step-by-step drills for youth coaches.\nThe \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d piece filled four magazine pages and broke the concept into three progressive training blocks, each specifying recommended pitch dimensions, work-to-rest ratios, and suggested adaptations for under-13, under-15, and under-17 age groups.\nA highlighted sidebar within the article quoted head coach Marlen Tiravo explaining how a simple verbal cue of \u201cstep and cover\u201d helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players coordinate their movements when initiating the paired press in competitive matches.\nOn the afternoon of 2025-06-30, head coach Marlen Tiravo held a classroom-style review session at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy training facility where Marlen Tiravo distributed copies of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series by Lina Veress to the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.\nThe review session took place in a small upstairs meeting room overlooking the indoor training court, with around a dozen players seated at desks while head coach Marlen Tiravo used a whiteboard and a projector to walk through key diagrams from the magazine.\nHead coach Marlen Tiravo asked each player of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to highlight at least one paragraph that reflected their own habits, leading to a brief discussion in which several players expressed surprise at seeing their off-the-ball work described in print.\nBy the evening of 2025-06-30, several school futsal coaches in Selvarin City, including Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach Harven Soll, reported using the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly articles by Lina Veress as practical reference material for planning upcoming youth training sessions.\nCoach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 marked specific drills from \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d with sticky notes in his planning notebook and penciled them into his July pre-season schedule as alternatives to his standard defensive warm-up routines.\nOther coaches in Selvarin City mentioned in informal messages to editor Ralen Ko that they appreciated the clear field diagrams and ready-made session plans, which allowed them to adapt Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 concepts without having to design exercises from scratch.\nIn a brief comment published alongside the feature series on 2025-06-30, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council development coordinator Neris Dalvo stated that Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council did not plan to produce separate official school case-study booklets about the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 title run.\nThe note from development coordinator Neris Dalvo appeared in a shaded \u201cCouncil Perspective\u201d box at the bottom of the first feature page, where Neris Dalvo cited limited staff capacity and a preference for issuing broader coaching guidelines rather than detailed profiles of single teams.\nIn the same comment, development coordinator Neris Dalvo nevertheless thanked Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 for setting \u201ca positive standard for preparation and sportsmanship\u201d and expressed support for independent publications that highlighted constructive youth coaching practices.\nDespite the absence of dedicated case-study materials from Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council, local coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone and broader Selvarin City began informally treating the series by Lina Veress in Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly as a de facto reference document for youth futsal training discussions.\nDuring informal planning conversations and email exchanges on 2025-06-30, several coaches referred to specific pages of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly issue\u2014such as the transition-attack diagram on page 11\u2014as shorthand examples when debating how aggressively to press with teenage players.\nSome coaches in the Grendale Suburban Zone scanned or photographed selected layouts from the feature series and shared them within small staff groups, using the material as a common visual basis for adjusting their own session content rather than as any kind of official curriculum.\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures.

A</name><type>concept</type></miscellaneous>\n</entities>\n\nThe definitions with examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural landmarks, and regions.\nExamples: Paris, Mount Everest, California, Amazon Rainforest, Japan, Australia, Australian\n\n- Product\nDefinition: Goods or services created for consumer use or commercial purposes.\nExamples: iPhone, Coca-Cola, Microsoft Office, Tesla Model 3\n\n- Art\nDefinition: Creative works in various forms, including artifacts, ornaments, visual arts, literature, music, and performance.\nExamples: Mona Lisa, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Hamilton (musical)\n\n - Building\nDefinition: Structures designed for human occupancy or use, including residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity. However, this phrase contains the named entity Chicago (location)\n\nExample: \"I bought tickets to go on the Sky Needle, the highest skyscraper in town!\"\n- \"Sky Needle\" is a named entity (building)\n\nExample: \"Aboriginal people from a well known Australian city.\"\n- \"Aboriginal\" is a named entity (Organization)\n- \"Australia\" is a named entity (Location)\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

The final day program at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final. {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} entered the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} as the qualifying representative team of the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} of {Selvarin City|LOCATION-2}. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} had secured the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign. The squad of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won all three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} to finish first in {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}. In {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} recorded a 3\u20130 win over {Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17|ORGANIZATION-4}, a 2\u20131 victory against {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5}, and a 1\u20130 result over {Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17|ORGANIZATION-6}. The group-stage fixtures for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} were played over three consecutive evenings at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The lone group-stage goal against {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward {Laren Vos|PERSON-1} of {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5} late in the first half of their second group match. Goalkeeper {Ren Talvek|PERSON-2} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} defeated {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. In the semifinal, winger {Daren Mol|PERSON-3} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot {Jorin Kale|PERSON-4} netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine. The semifinal between {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} and {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} was officiated by referee {Elvin Sarro|PERSON-5} and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches. The 2\u20131 semifinal victory over {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} gave {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a second goal conceded in the entire {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} restored the lead. Despite the setback, the defensive unit of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} responded by limiting {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won the final of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} with a 3\u20130 victory over {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}. The final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} captain and playmaker {Mikel Ardan|PERSON-6} scoring twice and flank player {Sera Noll|PERSON-7} adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages. {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves. With five wins from five matches, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} secured the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} title while conceding only two goals in the tournament. Across the five matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} scored a total of 11 goals, finishing with the best goal difference of any team in the competition. Several school coaches and spectators at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} remarked that the consistency shown by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} across all phases of play set a benchmark for future editions of the under-17 event. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} credited the championship success of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} media team. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8}, who has led youth teams at {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy|ORGANIZATION-3} for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills. During the interview conducted courtside by council media officer {Lina Veress|PERSON-9}, head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period. The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} awarded {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a development grant for new training equipment in recognition of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} victory by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. The development grant from the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} was announced as a package valued at approximately 3,000 {selvars|MISCELLANEOUS-1}, earmarked for purchasing new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility training gear for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. Representatives of the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} handed the official grant confirmation letter to head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} at the edge of the main court, with the players of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} gathered around in team tracksuits.</outline></event>",

    "STORYITEM_XML": "<storyitems>\n<storyitem>In early June 2025, editor Ralen Ko of the regional magazine Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly commissioned sports communications officer Lina Veress to write a print feature series on the title run of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>During a planning meeting at the modest Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly office near the eastern tram loop in Selvarin City, editor Ralen Ko outlined a three-part, 10\u201312 page series and asked Lina Veress to submit a first draft by 2025-06-20 to meet the mid-year print deadline.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Editor Ralen Ko specifically cited the composed courtside interview that Lina Veress had conducted with head coach Marlen Tiravo after the final as a key reason for assigning the feature, believing that Lina Veress could balance tactical detail with human-interest storytelling for a youth audience.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>On 2025-06-18, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council granted Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly permission to reproduce selected statistics and photographs from the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship in the feature series authored by Lina Veress.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The permission was confirmed in a two-page email agreement signed off by Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council chairperson Doran Helv, stipulating that all images be credit-lined to the council archive and used only in connection with non-elite youth futsal education.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Along with the written approval, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council provided Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly with a folder of 24 high-resolution action photographs and the official match-statistics spreadsheets for all five fixtures played by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>In preparation for the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series, Lina Veress conducted extended interviews with head coach Marlen Tiravo of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 focusing on training structure, team culture, and the weeks leading up to the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The interviews consisted of two evening video calls and one in-person conversation at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy office, each lasting around 70 to 90 minutes, with head coach Marlen Tiravo bringing along a binder of weekly training schedules from January to March 2025.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>During these discussions, head coach Marlen Tiravo described specific routines such as Monday small-sided pressing games and Thursday match-simulation blocks, and emphasized to Lina Veress how player-led feedback circles on Fridays had helped shape the squad\u2019s sense of collective responsibility.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly staff used match footage from Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center to create tactical diagrams and sequence illustrations that visually supported the written analysis by Lina Veress of the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 performances.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The magazine\u2019s two-person analysis team replayed key passages from the semifinal and final on a large screen in their editing room, manually logging pressing triggers, passing lanes, and player rotations that could be translated into simplified diagrams for young readers.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Graphic designer Hele Narm transformed these notes into four full-page diagrams and several smaller in-text sequences, using colored arrows and numbered frames to show how Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 shifted from a compact 2\u20132 block into coordinated counter-attacks.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>On the morning of 2025-06-30, Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly released its mid-year print issue featuring a multi-part analytical series by Lina Veress on the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 campaign at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The issue, Volume 13 Number 2, had a print run of approximately 2,500 copies and was distributed to secondary schools, community sports halls, and neighborhood kiosks across Selvarin City and the Grendale Suburban Zone at a cover price of 8 selvars.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The front cover of the mid-year issue featured a full-width photograph of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 captain Mikel Ardan lifting the championship trophy, with a headline banner reading \u201cHow Grendale Built a Champion Team.\u201d</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Within the 2025-06-30 issue of Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly, an article titled \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d by Lina Veress detailed a recurring defensive pattern used by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 during the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship and translated it into step-by-step drills for youth coaches.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d piece filled four magazine pages and broke the concept into three progressive training blocks, each specifying recommended pitch dimensions, work-to-rest ratios, and suggested adaptations for under-13, under-15, and under-17 age groups.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>A highlighted sidebar within the article quoted head coach Marlen Tiravo explaining how a simple verbal cue of \u201cstep and cover\u201d helped Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 players coordinate their movements when initiating the paired press in competitive matches.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>On the afternoon of 2025-06-30, head coach Marlen Tiravo held a classroom-style review session at the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy training facility where Marlen Tiravo distributed copies of the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly feature series by Lina Veress to the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The review session took place in a small upstairs meeting room overlooking the indoor training court, with around a dozen players seated at desks while head coach Marlen Tiravo used a whiteboard and a projector to walk through key diagrams from the magazine.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Head coach Marlen Tiravo asked each player of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to highlight at least one paragraph that reflected their own habits, leading to a brief discussion in which several players expressed surprise at seeing their off-the-ball work described in print.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>By the evening of 2025-06-30, several school futsal coaches in Selvarin City, including Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 coach Harven Soll, reported using the Selvarin Youth Sport Quarterly articles by Lina Veress as practical reference material for planning upcoming youth training sessions.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Coach Harven Soll of Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17 marked specific drills from \u201cPressing in Pairs\u201d with sticky notes in his planning notebook and penciled them into his July pre-season schedule as alternatives to his standard defensive warm-up routines.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Other coaches in Selvarin City mentioned in informal messages to editor Ralen Ko that they appreciated the clear field diagrams and ready-made session plans, which allowed them to adapt Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 concepts without having to design exercises from scratch.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>In a brief comment published alongside the feature series on 2025-06-30, Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council development coordinator Neris Dalvo stated that Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council did not plan to produce separate official school case-study booklets about the Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 title run.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>The note from development coordinator Neris Dalvo appeared in a shaded \u201cCouncil Perspective\u201d box at the bottom of the first feature page, where Neris Dalvo cited
