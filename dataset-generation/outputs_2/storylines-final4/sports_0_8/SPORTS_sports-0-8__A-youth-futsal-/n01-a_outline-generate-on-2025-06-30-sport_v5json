  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with generating an outline for a fictional event. Your goal is to create a realistic, entirely fictional event that does not overlap with real-world named entities or known fictional named entities. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\nFirst, review the list of already known fictional named entities of this fictional world:\n\n<known_entities>\n<LOCATIONS>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n</LOCATIONS>\n\n<PERSONS>\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n</PERSONS>\n\n<ORGANIZATIONS>\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n</ORGANIZATIONS>\n\n<PRODUCTS>\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n</PRODUCTS>\n\n<ARTS>\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n</ARTS>\n\n<EVENTS>\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n</EVENTS>\n\n<BUILDINGS>\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n</BUILDINGS>\n\n<MISCELLANEOUS>\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</MISCELLANEOUS>\n</known_entities>\nNext, review the outline of previous events that have occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\nNow, consider the following information about the new event you need to generate as a continuation of the past events:\n\nDate: {{PROVIDED_DATE}}\n\nEvent Summary: {{EVENT_SUMMARY}}\n\nGenre: {{GENRE}}\n\nFollow these guidelines to generate the event outline:\n\n1. Create an entirely fictional event based on the given genre, event summary, and history of previous events. The event must be realistic but must not reference any existing real-world or known fictional named entities.\n2. Invent new named entities as needed, ensuring they don't exist in the real world or in existing works of fiction. When creating names, use unique combinations unlikely to match real named entities.\n3. Construct the outline using short, concise, factual, and objective statements. Each statement must discuss only one fact or sub-event, structured sequentially in a logical temporal order when applicable.\n4. Ensure all statements form a coherent outline.\n5. Output each statement within a <storyitem> tag.\n6. Generate exactly {{NUM_STORYITEMS}} distinct story items.\n7. Ensure logical progression, with each statement following chronologically when applicable. Include a mix of main events, reactions, consequences, and contextual information.\n8. Make storyitems as atomic as possible, communicating only a single piece of relevant information per item. Do not merge multiple pieces of information into one storyitem.\n9. Ensure the story sounds realistic without explicitly stating it's fictional.\n10. Maintain consistency with the provided <history> that discusses past events fictional events. The outline must logically follow chronological events described in the history.\n11. Incorporate some or all of the provided named entities in your outline. Ensure that any mention of these entities is consistent with the information you have about the named entity. You may introduce additional fictional entities as needed, but they must not conflict with the existing ones.\n12. When referencing any named entities from the provided inputs, maintain consistency in their descriptions and roles within the story.\n13. If no date is provided: Generate a complete date for the event, including the year. The date should be formatted as \"year-month-day\" (e.g., \"2024-12-03\" or \"2025-06-13\"). This date should be consistent with the timeline established in the <history>.\n14. If a date is provided: Use the provided date.\n15. The outline can include quotes from the named entities where applicable.\n16. Do not repeat the information from the previous events from the <history>.\n17. Refer to all named entities (the new named entities and the known named entities) by their full \"name\" property. DO NOT refer to the named entities using the ID.\n18. Make sure that you refer to all named entities within each storyitem per full name at least once. DO NOT use pronouns to refer to a named entity from the previous story item.\n19. Think about the content that is appropriate for the event summary given the genre, provided history: Think about which dimensions align with all of those, and sound like a realistic event.\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<date>year-month-day</date>\n<outline>\n<storyitem>First story item</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Second story item</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Third story item</storyitem>\n...\n</outline>\n</results>\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The event must be entirely realistic, even though it is fictional. Do not include any science fiction or fantasy elements. The story should read like a plausible current event.\n- Do not use any galactic events. The fictional world should be similar to our world but not about galaxies or outer space.\n- Each story item must only discuss one fact or subevent. Ensure that each story item is specific, concise, and focused on a single piece of information.\n- Begin your response with <results> and end it with </results>. Do not include any text outside of these tags.\n- Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n- Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n- Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n- Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\nRemember:\nThe outline should center on a fictional but realistic event, keeping its scale aligned with the event summary and provided <history> without exaggerating its impact. Rather than overstating the event's significance, the outline should stay within the scope appropriate to the genre, provided history, and provided summary. When in doubt, focus on detailed, localized developments instead of amplifying global effects.\n\nEnsure that the outline is coherent, follows a logical sequence, and offers a unique perspective on the given event while maintaining consistency with the provided background information.",

{Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} on 2025-03-22. The final day program at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final. {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} entered the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} as the qualifying representative team of the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} of {Selvarin City|LOCATION-2}. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} had secured the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign. The squad of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won all three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} to finish first in {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}. In {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} recorded a 3\u20130 win over {Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17|ORGANIZATION-4}, a 2\u20131 victory against {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5}, and a 1\u20130 result over {Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17|ORGANIZATION-6}. The group-stage fixtures for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} were played over three consecutive evenings at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The lone group-stage goal against {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward {Laren Vos|PERSON-1} of {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5} late in the first half of their second group match. Goalkeeper {Ren Talvek|PERSON-2} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} defeated {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. In the semifinal, winger {Daren Mol|PERSON-3} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot {Jorin Kale|PERSON-4} netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine. The semifinal between {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} and {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} was officiated by referee {Elvin Sarro|PERSON-5} and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches. The 2\u20131 semifinal victory over {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} gave {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a second goal conceded in the entire {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} restored the lead. Despite the setback, the defensive unit of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} responded by limiting {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won the final of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} with a 3\u20130 victory over {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}. The final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} captain and playmaker {Mikel Ardan|PERSON-6} scoring twice and flank player {Sera Noll|PERSON-7} adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages. {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves. With five wins from five matches, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} secured the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} title while conceding only two goals in the tournament. Across the five matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} scored a total of 11 goals, finishing with the best goal difference of any team in the competition. Several school coaches and spectators at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} remarked that the consistency shown by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} across all phases of play set a benchmark for future editions of the under-17 event. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} credited the championship success of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} media team. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8}, who has led youth teams at {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy|ORGANIZATION-3} for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills. During the interview conducted courtside by council media officer {Lina Veress|PERSON-9}, head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period. The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} awarded {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a development grant for new training equipment in recognition of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} victory by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. The development grant from the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} was announced as a package valued at approximately 3,000 {selvars|MISCELLANEOUS-1}, earmarked for purchasing new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility training gear for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. Representatives of the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} handed the official grant confirmation letter to head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} at the edge of the main court, with the players of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} gathered around in team tracksuits.</outline></event>\n</history>\n\nNow, consider the following information about the new event you need to generate as a continuation of the past events:\n\nDate: 2025-06-30\n\nEvent Summary: On 2025-06-30, sports communications officer Lina Veress released an in-depth print feature series in a regional youth sports magazine dissecting Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17\u2019s title run at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship, which local coaches cited as a practical reference even though no separate school case-study materials were produced.\n\nGenre: Sports\n\nFollow these guidelines to generate the event outline:\n\n1. Create an entirely fictional event based on the given genre, event summary, and history of previous events. The event must be realistic but must not reference any existing real-world or known fictional named entities.\n2. Invent new named entities as needed, ensuring they don't exist in the real world or in existing works of fiction. When creating names, use unique combinations unlikely to match real named entities.\n3. Construct the outline using short, concise, factual, and objective statements. Each statement must discuss only one fact or sub-event, structured sequentially in a logical temporal order when applicable.\n4. Ensure all statements form a coherent outline.\n5. Output each statement within a <storyitem> tag.\n6. Generate exactly 10 distinct story items.\n7. Ensure logical progression, with each statement following chronologically when applicable. Include a mix of main events, reactions, consequences, and contextual information.\n8. Make storyitems as atomic as possible, communicating only a single piece of relevant information per item. Do not merge multiple pieces of information into one storyitem.\n9. Ensure the story sounds realistic without explicitly stating it's fictional.\n10. Maintain consistency with the provided <history> that discusses past events fictional events. The outline must logically follow chronological events described in the history.\n11. Incorporate some or all of the provided named entities in your outline. Ensure that any mention of these entities is consistent with the information you have about the named entity. You may introduce additional fictional entities as needed, but they must not conflict with the existing ones.\n12. When referencing any named entities from the provided inputs, maintain consistency in their descriptions and roles within the story.\n13. If no date is provided: Generate a complete date for the event, including the year. The date should be formatted as \"year-month-day\" (e.g., \"2024-12-03\" or \"2025-06-13\"). This date should be consistent with the timeline established in the <history>.\n14. If a date is provided: Use the provided date.\n15. The outline can include quotes from the named entities where applicable.\n16. Do not repeat the information from the previous events from the <history>.\n17. Refer to all named entities (the new named entities and the known named entities) by their full \"name\" property. DO NOT refer to the named entities using the ID.\n18. Make sure that you refer to all named entities within each storyitem per full name at least once. DO NOT use pronouns to refer to a named entity from the previous story item.\n19. Think about the content that is appropriate for the event summary given the genre, provided history: Think about which dimensions align with all of those, and sound like a realistic event.\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<date>year-month-day</date>\n<outline>\n<storyitem>First story item</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Second story item</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Third story item</storyitem>\n...\n</outline>\n</results>\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The event must be entirely realistic, even though it is fictional. Do not include any science fiction or fantasy elements. The story should read like a plausible current event.\n- Do not use any galactic events. The fictional world should be similar to our world but not about galaxies or outer space.\n- Each story item must only discuss one fact or subevent. Ensure that each story item is specific, concise, and focused on a single piece of information.\n- Begin your response with <results> and end it with </results>. Do not include any text outside of these tags.\n- Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n- Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n- Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n- Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\nRemember:\nThe outline should center on a fictional but realistic event, keeping its scale aligned with the event summary and provided <history> without exaggerating its impact. Rather than overstating the event's significance, the outline should stay within the scope appropriate to the genre, provided history, and provided summary. When in doubt, focus on detailed, localized developments instead of amplifying global effects.\n\nEnsure that the outline is coherent, follows a logical sequence, and offers a unique perspective on the given event while maintaining consistency with the provided background information.",
