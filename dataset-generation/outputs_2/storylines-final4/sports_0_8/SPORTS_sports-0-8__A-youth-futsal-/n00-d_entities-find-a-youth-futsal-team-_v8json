  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying new named entities from a given outline of a fictional event description. Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<OUTLINE>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures. Note that these lists may be empty or contain partial information:\n\n<entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</entities>\n\nThe definitions with examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural landmarks, and regions.\nExamples: Paris, Mount Everest, California, Amazon Rainforest, Japan, Australia, Australian\n\n- Product\nDefinition: Goods or services created for consumer use or commercial purposes.\nExamples: iPhone, Coca-Cola, Microsoft Office, Tesla Model 3\n\n- Art\nDefinition: Creative works in various forms, including artifacts, ornaments, visual arts, literature, music, and performance.\nExamples: Mona Lisa, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Hamilton (musical)\n\n - Building\nDefinition: Structures designed for human occupancy or use, including residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity.

Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

OUTLINE:\n\nDate: 2025-03-22\n<OUTLINE>\nThe Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council hosted the final day of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship at Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center on 2025-03-22.\nThe final day program at Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final.\nSelvarin Orvath Indoor Center featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures.\nGrendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 entered the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship as the qualifying representative team of the Grendale Suburban Zone of Selvarin City.\nGrendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 had secured the Grendale Suburban Zone berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign.\nThe squad of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist.\nGrendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 won all three group-stage matches of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship to finish first in Group A.\nIn Group A, Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 recorded a 3\u20130 win over Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17, a 2\u20131 victory against Selvarin East Secondary Under-17, and a 1\u20130 result over Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17.\nThe group-stage fixtures for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 were played over three consecutive evenings at Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match.\nGrendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.\nThe lone group-stage goal against Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward Laren Vos of Selvarin East Secondary Under-17 late in the first half of their second group match.\nGoalkeeper Ren Talvek of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads.\nGrendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 defeated Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17 by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.\nIn the semifinal, winger Daren Mol of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot Jorin Kale netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine.\nThe semifinal between Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 and Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17 was officiated by referee Elvin Sarro and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches.\nThe 2\u20131 semifinal victory over Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17 gave Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 a second goal conceded in the entire Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.\nThe goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 restored the lead.\nDespite the setback, the defensive unit of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 responded by limiting Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17 to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes.\nGrendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 won the final of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship with a 3\u20130 victory over Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17 at Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center.\nThe final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 captain and playmaker Mikel Ardan scoring twice and flank player Sera Noll adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages.\nSelvarin Central Sports School Under-17 struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves.\nWith five wins from five matches, Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 secured the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship title while conceding only two goals in the tournament.\nAcross the five matches of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship, Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 scored a total of 11 goals, finishing with the best goal difference of any team in the competition.\nSeveral school coaches and spectators at Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center remarked that the consistency shown by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 across all phases of play set a benchmark for future editions of the under-17 event.\nHead coach Marlen Tiravo of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 credited the championship success of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council media team.\nHead coach Marlen Tiravo, who has led youth teams at Grendale Youth Futsal Academy for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills.\nDuring the interview conducted courtside by council media officer Lina Veress, head coach Marlen Tiravo stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period.\nThe Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council awarded Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 a development grant for new training equipment in recognition of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship victory by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.\nThe development grant from the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council was announced as a package valued at approximately 3,000 selvars, earmarked for purchasing new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility training gear for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.\nRepresentatives of the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council handed the official grant confirmation letter to head coach Marlen Tiravo at the edge of the main court, with the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 gathered around in team tracksuits.\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in
