2025-03-22.\nThe final day program at Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final.\nSelvarin Orvath Indoor Center featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures.\nGrendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 entered the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship as the qualifying representative team of the Grendale Suburban Zone of Selvarin City.\nGrendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 had secured the Grendale Suburban Zone berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign.\nThe squad of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist.\nGrendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 won all three group-stage matches of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship to finish first in Group A.\nIn Group A, Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 recorded a 3\u20130 win over Meadowlane

opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot Jorin Kale netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine.\nThe semifinal between Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 and Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17 was officiated by referee Elvin Sarro and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches.\nThe 2\u20131 semifinal victory over Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17 gave Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 a second goal conceded in the entire Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship.\nThe goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 restored the lead.\nDespite the setback, the defensive unit of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 responded by limiting Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17 to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes.\nGrendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 won the final of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship with a 3\u20130 victory over Selvarin Central Sports

flank player Sera Noll adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages.\nSelvarin Central Sports School Under-17 struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves.\nWith five wins from five matches, Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 secured the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship title while conceding only two goals in the tournament.\nAcross the five matches of the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship, Grendale Youth Futsal

Futsal Academy Under-17 credited the championship success of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council media team.\nHead coach Marlen Tiravo, who has led youth teams at Grendale Youth Futsal Academy for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills.\nDuring the interview conducted courtside by council media officer Lina Veress, head coach Marlen Tiravo stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period.\nThe Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council awarded

goals, and agility training gear for Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17.\nRepresentatives of the Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council handed the official grant confirmation letter to head coach Marlen Tiravo at the edge of the main court, with the players of Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17 gathered around in team tracksuits.\n</outline>\n\n3.
