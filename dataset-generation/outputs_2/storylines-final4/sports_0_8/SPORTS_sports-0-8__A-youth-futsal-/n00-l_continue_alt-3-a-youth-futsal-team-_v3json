  "instructions": "You are an AI tasked with creating alternative fictional future news summaries based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate summaries of plausible alternative continuations of an existing narrative. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. First, you will be given known entities in this fictional world:\n\n<known_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</known_entities>\n\n2. Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>{{CONTINUATION_TEXT}}</text>\n<date>{{CONTINUATION_DATE}}</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create {{NUM_ALTERNATIVES}} contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre {{GENRE}}. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n<event><date>2025-03-22</date><outline>The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} hosted the final day of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} on 2025-03-22. The final day program at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final. {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} entered the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} as the qualifying representative team of the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} of {Selvarin City|LOCATION-2}. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} had secured the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign. The squad of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won all three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} to finish first in {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}. In {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} recorded a 3\u20130 win over {Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17|ORGANIZATION-4}, a 2\u20131 victory against {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5}, and a 1\u20130 result over {Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17|ORGANIZATION-6}. The group-stage fixtures for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} were played over three consecutive evenings at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The lone group-stage goal against {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward {Laren Vos|PERSON-1} of {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5} late in the first half of their second group match. Goalkeeper {Ren Talvek|PERSON-2} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} defeated {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. In the semifinal, winger {Daren Mol|PERSON-3} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot {Jorin Kale|PERSON-4} netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine. The semifinal between {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} and {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} was officiated by referee {Elvin Sarro|PERSON-5} and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches. The 2\u20131 semifinal victory over {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} gave {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a second goal conceded in the entire {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} restored the lead. Despite the setback, the defensive unit of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} responded by limiting {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won the final of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} with a 3\u20130 victory over {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}. The final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} captain and playmaker {Mikel Ardan|PERSON-6} scoring twice and flank player {Sera Noll|PERSON-7} adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages. {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves. With five wins from five matches, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} secured the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} title while conceding only two goals in the tournament. Across the five matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} scored a total of 11 goals, finishing with the best goal difference of any team in the competition. Several school coaches and spectators at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} remarked that the consistency shown by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} across all phases of play set a benchmark for future editions of the under-17 event. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} credited the championship success of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} to defensive discipline and consistent training in a post-final interview with the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} media team. Head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8}, who has led youth teams at {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy|ORGANIZATION-3} for five seasons, highlighted that the under-17 squad had trained four evenings per week since January with a special focus on pressing and transition drills. During the interview conducted courtside by council media officer {Lina Veress|PERSON-9}, head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} stated that the players had \u201ctreated every session as if it were a final,\u201d emphasizing their commitment and punctuality throughout the preparation period. The {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} awarded {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a development grant for new training equipment in recognition of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} victory by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. The development grant from the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} was announced as a package valued at approximately 3,000 {selvars|MISCELLANEOUS-1}, earmarked for purchasing new futsal balls, portable goals, and agility training gear for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}. Representatives of the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} handed the official grant confirmation letter to head coach {Marlen Tiravo|PERSON-8} at the edge of the main court, with the players of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} gathered around in team tracksuits.</outline></event>\n</history>\n\n3. You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>Sports communications officer Lina Veress published a multi-part feature highlighting the preparation, tactics, and personal stories behind Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17\u2019s title run at the Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship, which was distributed to local schools as a case study in teamwork and resilience.</text>\n<date>2025-06-30</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create 3 contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre Sports. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

The final day program at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} began at 09:00 with warm-up sessions and team check-ins, with the main court stands gradually filling to an estimated crowd of around 450 spectators by the time of the afternoon final. {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1} featured two regulation futsal courts with a blue synthetic surface and electronic scoreboards, and the {Orvath Ridge Schools Futsal Council|ORGANIZATION-1} used the central court exclusively for the under-17 semifinal and final fixtures. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} entered the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} as the qualifying representative team of the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} of {Selvarin City|LOCATION-2}. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} had secured the {Grendale Suburban Zone|LOCATION-1} berth two weeks earlier by finishing top of the zone\u2019s qualifying league on goal difference after a six-match campaign. The squad of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} registered for the tournament consisted of 12 players aged between 15 and 17 years, coached and supported by a staff group of four including a fitness coach and a team physiotherapist. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won all three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} to finish first in {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}. In {Group A|MISCELLANEOUS-2}, {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} recorded a 3\u20130 win over {Meadowlane School Futsal Under-17|ORGANIZATION-4}, a 2\u20131 victory against {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5}, and a 1\u20130 result over {Orvath Ridge Collegiate Under-17|ORGANIZATION-6}. The group-stage fixtures for {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} were played over three consecutive evenings at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}, with the team mathematically securing a semifinal place after just the second match. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} conceded only one goal during the three group-stage matches of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The lone group-stage goal against {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was scored from a 6-meter penalty by forward {Laren Vos|PERSON-1} of {Selvarin East Secondary Under-17|ORGANIZATION-5} late in the first half of their second group match. Goalkeeper {Ren Talvek|PERSON-2} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} was named player of the match in two of the three group fixtures after making several close-range saves to preserve narrow leads. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} defeated {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} by 2\u20131 in the semifinal of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. In the semifinal, winger {Daren Mol|PERSON-3} of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} opened the scoring in the 7th minute, and pivot {Jorin Kale|PERSON-4} netted the decisive second goal midway through the second half after a set-play corner routine. The semifinal between {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} and {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} was officiated by referee {Elvin Sarro|PERSON-5} and two assistant referees, with the match played at a high tempo and several tactical time-outs called by both benches. The 2\u20131 semifinal victory over {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} gave {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} a second goal conceded in the entire {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1}. The goal conceded in the semifinal came from a deflected long-range shot early in the second half, briefly leveling the score at 1\u20131 before {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} restored the lead. Despite the setback, the defensive unit of {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} responded by limiting {Selvarin Riverside Training Center Under-17|ORGANIZATION-7} to speculative efforts from distance in the final minutes. {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} won the final of the {Orvath Ridge Under-17 Futsal Championship|EVENT-1} with a 3\u20130 victory over {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} at {Selvarin Orvath Indoor Center|BUILDING-1}. The final kicked off at 16:30 on the main court, with {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2} captain and playmaker {Mikel Ardan|PERSON-6} scoring twice and flank player {Sera Noll|PERSON-7} adding a third goal on a fast break in the closing stages. {Selvarin Central Sports School Under-17|ORGANIZATION-8} struggled to break down the compact 2\u20132 defensive shape employed by {Grendale Youth Futsal Academy Under-17|ORGANIZATION-2}, managing only a handful of shots on target over the two 20-minute halves.
