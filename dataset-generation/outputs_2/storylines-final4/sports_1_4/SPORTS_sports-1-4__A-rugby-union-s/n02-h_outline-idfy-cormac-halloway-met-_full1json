      "The meeting convened at 11:00 BST and included two Harwick Vale Rugby Club staff members in attendance as observers: the club's communications officer and the academy manager.",
      "The meeting was arranged following an exchange of emails between Harwick Community Supporters' Trust and Harwick Vale Rugby Club earlier in the week and was described by both sides as an initial, informal engagement rather than a formal grievance hearing.",
      "Dr. Isla Marden moderated the community question-and-answer session on behalf of Harwick Vale Rugby Club.",
      "Dr. Isla Marden introduced the session by explaining the format and by stating that the session would follow a moderated Q&A structure with predetermined topics to keep the discussion focused.",
      "The community question-and-answer session lasted 45 minutes and was held in a meeting room at Harwick Vale Rugby Club's training ground.",
      "The meeting took place in the club's smaller conference room, which seats up to 20 people and features a whiteboard and a wall-mounted timetable of the upcoming preseason schedule.",
      "The session was timed to avoid interfering with first-team training hours and concluded promptly at 11:45 BST to allow coaching staff to begin pitch work at noon.",
      "Cormac Halloway told attendees that he remained willing to engage with supporters and to participate in community-facing activities organised by Harwick Vale Rugby Club.",
      "Cormac Halloway gave examples of past community activities he had taken part in, noting recent school visits and a local youth-clinic he ran last spring, and said he would continue similar outreach while balancing preseason preparations.",
      "Cormac Halloway announced a schedule of weekly open coaching sessions for promoted academy players to be held at Harwick Vale Rugby Club's training ground beginning the week commencing 2025-08-04.",
      "The announced weekly coaching sessions were scheduled for Tuesday evenings at 18:00 BST and Saturday mornings at 09:00 BST, with each session planned to last around 75 minutes and to focus on position-specific drills and conditioning.",
      "Harwick Vale Rugby Club indicated the sessions would be limited to players on first-year development contracts and that the academy manager would confirm final participant lists one week before the first session.",
      "Dr. Isla Marden said Harwick Vale Rugby Club would publish the coaching session times and participant eligibility criteria on the Harwick Vale Rugby Club website by 2025-08-02.",
      "Dr. Isla Marden added that the published notice would include an online sign-up form, a parental-consent template for under-18 players, and a contact email for the academy manager where eligibility queries could be directed.",
      "Rowan Ferley asked how Jules Renby would be integrated into first-team training and whether the planned coaching sessions would support that transition.",
      "Rowan Ferley requested clarification on whether Jules Renby would be phased into full-contact sessions immediately or given a tailored programme during his first two weeks with the senior squad to ease the transition.",
      "Rowan Ferley also asked whether Harwick Vale Rugby Club intended to assign a specific senior player or coach to mentor Jules Renby during his initial integration period.",
      "Priya Sander said Harwick Community Supporters' Trust would circulate a brief summary of the meeting to season-ticket holders and local members.",

      "Priya Sander added that the circulated summary would exclude any matters both parties agreed were confidential and would invite members to submit follow-up questions for a potential future open forum.",
      "Cormac Halloway declined to answer contractual and budgetary questions during the session and advised that such inquiries should be directed to Harwick Vale Rugby Club's finance team and the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office.",
      "Cormac Halloway said he had been briefed by Harwick Vale Rugby Club not to discuss commercially sensitive matters and suggested that the Trust forward specific document requests to the club's finance team for formal handling.",
      "All participants agreed to seek formal guidance from the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office on what contractual information Harwick Vale Rugby Club could publish publicly following the meeting.",
      "Attendees agreed that Harwick Community Supporters' Trust would prepare a short list of precise data items it wished the compliance office to consider and that both the Trust and Harwick Vale Rugby Club would jointly submit the request for written guidance.",
      "All participants set a target to follow up within seven calendar days by jointly emailing the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office to request written guidance on the specific categories of contractual and budgetary information discussed at the session."

    "OUTLINE": "Cormac Halloway met informally with Harwick Community Supporters' Trust representatives Rowan Ferley and Priya Sander at Harwick Vale Rugby Club's training ground for a moderated community question-and-answer session.\nThe meeting convened at 11:00 BST and included two Harwick Vale Rugby Club staff members in attendance as observers: the club's communications officer and the academy manager.\nThe meeting was arranged following an exchange of emails between Harwick Community Supporters' Trust and Harwick Vale Rugby Club earlier in the week and was described by both sides as an initial, informal engagement rather than a formal grievance hearing.\nDr. Isla Marden moderated the community question-and-answer session on behalf of Harwick Vale Rugby Club.\nDr. Isla Marden introduced the session by explaining the format and by stating that the session would follow a moderated Q&A structure with predetermined topics to keep the discussion focused.\nThe community question-and-answer session lasted 45 minutes and was held in a meeting room at Harwick Vale Rugby Club's training ground.\nThe meeting took place in the club's smaller conference room, which seats up to 20 people and features a whiteboard and a wall-mounted timetable of the upcoming preseason schedule.\nThe session was timed to avoid interfering with first-team training hours and concluded promptly at 11:45 BST to allow coaching staff to begin pitch work at noon.\nCormac Halloway told attendees that he remained willing to engage with supporters and to participate in community-facing activities organised by Harwick Vale Rugby Club.\nCormac Halloway gave examples of past community activities he had taken part in, noting recent school visits and a local youth-clinic he ran last spring, and said he would continue similar outreach while balancing preseason preparations.\nCormac Halloway announced a schedule of weekly open coaching sessions for promoted academy players to be held at Harwick Vale Rugby Club's training ground beginning the week commencing 2025-08-04.\nThe announced weekly coaching sessions were scheduled for Tuesday evenings at 18:00 BST and Saturday mornings at 09:00 BST, with each session planned to last around 75 minutes and to focus on position-specific drills and conditioning.\nHarwick Vale Rugby Club indicated the sessions would be limited to players on first-year development contracts and that the academy manager would confirm final participant lists one week before the first session.\nDr. Isla Marden said Harwick Vale Rugby Club would publish the coaching session times and participant eligibility criteria on the Harwick Vale Rugby Club website by 2025-08-02.\nDr. Isla Marden added that the published notice would include an online sign-up form, a parental-consent template for under-18 players, and a contact email for the academy manager where eligibility queries could be directed.\nRowan Ferley asked how Jules Renby would be integrated into first-team training and whether the planned coaching sessions would support that transition.\nRowan Ferley requested clarification on whether Jules Renby would be phased into full-contact sessions immediately or given a tailored programme during his first two weeks with the senior squad to ease the transition.\nRowan Ferley also asked whether Harwick Vale Rugby Club intended to assign a specific senior player or coach to mentor Jules Renby during his initial integration period.\nPriya Sander said Harwick Community Supporters' Trust would circulate a brief summary of the meeting to season-ticket holders and local members.\nPriya Sander confirmed the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust planned to email the summary to its approximate 1,200 subscribed members and to post a short notice on the Trust's website within 48 hours of the meeting.\nPriya Sander added that the circulated summary would exclude any matters both parties agreed were confidential and would invite members to submit follow-up questions for a potential future open forum.\nCormac Halloway declined to answer contractual and budgetary questions during the session and advised that such inquiries should be directed to Harwick Vale Rugby Club's finance team and the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office.\nCormac Halloway said he had been briefed by Harwick Vale Rugby Club not to discuss commercially sensitive matters and suggested that the Trust forward specific document requests to the club's finance team for formal handling.\nAll participants agreed to seek formal guidance from the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office on what contractual information Harwick Vale Rugby Club could publish publicly following the meeting.\nAttendees agreed that Harwick Community Supporters' Trust would prepare a short list of precise data items it wished the compliance office to consider and that both the Trust and Harwick Vale Rugby Club would jointly submit the request for written guidance.\nAll participants set a target to follow up within seven calendar days by jointly emailing the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office to request written guidance on the specific categories of contractual and budgetary information discussed at the session.",
