  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with generating an outline for a fictional event. Your goal is to create a realistic, entirely fictional event that does not overlap with real-world named entities or known fictional named entities. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\nFirst, review the list of already known fictional named entities of this fictional world:\n\n<known_entities>\n<LOCATIONS>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n</LOCATIONS>\n\n<PERSONS>\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n</PERSONS>\n\n<ORGANIZATIONS>\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n</ORGANIZATIONS>\n\n<PRODUCTS>\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n</PRODUCTS>\n\n<ARTS>\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n</ARTS>\n\n<EVENTS>\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n</EVENTS>\n\n<BUILDINGS>\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n</BUILDINGS>\n\n<MISCELLANEOUS>\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</MISCELLANEOUS>\n</known_entities>\nNext, review the outline of previous events that have occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\nNow, consider the following information about the new event you need to generate as a continuation of the past events:\n\nDate: {{PROVIDED_DATE}}\n\nEvent Summary: {{EVENT_SUMMARY}}\n\nGenre: {{GENRE}}\n\nFollow these guidelines to generate the event outline:\n\n1. Create an entirely fictional event based on the given genre, event summary, and history of previous events. The event must be realistic but must not reference any existing real-world or known fictional named entities.\n2. Invent new named entities as needed, ensuring they don't exist in the real world or in existing works of fiction. When creating names, use unique combinations unlikely to match real named entities.\n3. Construct the outline using short, concise, factual, and objective statements. Each statement must discuss only one fact or sub-event, structured sequentially in a logical temporal order when applicable.\n4. Ensure all statements form a coherent outline.\n5. Output each statement within a <storyitem> tag.\n6. Generate exactly {{NUM_STORYITEMS}} distinct story items.\n7. Ensure logical progression, with each statement following chronologically when applicable. Include a mix of main events, reactions, consequences, and contextual information.\n8. Make storyitems as atomic as possible, communicating only a single piece of relevant information per item. Do not merge multiple pieces of information into one storyitem.\n9. Ensure the story sounds realistic without explicitly stating it's fictional.\n10. Maintain consistency with the provided <history> that discusses past events fictional events. The outline must logically follow chronological events described in the history.\n11. Incorporate some or all of the provided named entities in your outline. Ensure that any mention of these entities is consistent with the information you have about the named entity. You may introduce additional fictional entities as needed, but they must not conflict with the existing ones.\n12. When referencing any named entities from the provided inputs, maintain consistency in their descriptions and roles within the story.\n13. If no date is provided: Generate a complete date for the event, including the year. The date should be formatted as \"year-month-day\" (e.g., \"2024-12-03\" or \"2025-06-13\"). This date should be consistent with the timeline established in the <history>.\n14. If a date is provided: Use the provided date.\n15. The outline can include quotes from the named entities where applicable.\n16. Do not repeat the information from the previous events from the <history>.\n17. Refer to all named entities (the new named entities and the known named entities) by their full \"name\" property. DO NOT refer to the named entities using the ID.\n18. Make sure that you refer to all named entities within each storyitem per full name at least once. DO NOT use pronouns to refer to a named entity from the previous story item.\n19. Think about the content that is appropriate for the event summary given the genre, provided history: Think about which dimensions align with all of those, and sound like a realistic event.\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<date>year-month-day</date>\n<outline>\n<storyitem>First story item</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Second story item</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Third story item</storyitem>\n...\n</outline>\n</results>\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The event must be entirely realistic, even though it is fictional. Do not include any science fiction or fantasy elements. The story should read like a plausible current event.\n- Do not use any galactic events. The fictional world should be similar to our world but not about galaxies or outer space.\n- Each story item must only discuss one fact or subevent. Ensure that each story item is specific, concise, and focused on a single piece of information.\n- Begin your response with <results> and end it with </results>. Do not include any text outside of these tags.\n- Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n- Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n- Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n- Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\nRemember:\nThe outline should center on a fictional but realistic event, keeping its scale aligned with the event summary and provided <history> without exaggerating its impact. Rather than overstating the event's significance, the outline should stay within the scope appropriate to the genre, provided history, and provided summary. When in doubt, focus on detailed, localized developments instead of amplifying global effects.\n\nEnsure that the outline is coherent, follows a logical sequence, and offers a unique perspective on the given event while maintaining consistency with the provided background information.",

Create an entirely fictional event based on the given genre, event summary, and history of previous events. The event must be realistic but must not reference any existing real-world or known fictional named entities.\n2. Invent new named entities as needed, ensuring they don't exist in the real world or in existing works of fiction. When creating names, use unique combinations unlikely to match real named entities.\n3. Construct the outline using short, concise, factual, and objective statements. Each statement must discuss only one fact or sub-event, structured sequentially in a logical temporal order when applicable.\n4. Ensure all statements form a coherent outline.\n5. Output each statement within a <storyitem> tag.\n6. Generate exactly 10 distinct story items.\n7. Ensure logical progression, with each statement following chronologically when applicable. Include a mix of main events, reactions, consequences, and contextual information.\n8. Make storyitems as atomic as possible, communicating only a single piece of relevant information per item. Do not merge multiple pieces of information into one storyitem.\n9. Ensure the story sounds realistic without explicitly stating it's fictional.\n10. Maintain consistency with the provided <history> that discusses past events fictional events. The outline must logically follow chronological events described in the history.\n11. Incorporate some or all of the provided named entities in your outline. Ensure that any mention of these entities is consistent with the information you have about the named entity. You may introduce additional fictional entities as needed, but they must not conflict with the existing ones.\n12. When referencing any named entities from the provided inputs, maintain consistency in their descriptions and roles within the story.\n13. If no date is provided: Generate a complete date for the event, including the year. The date should be formatted as \"year-month-day\" (e.g., \"2024-12-03\" or \"2025-06-13\"). This date should be consistent with the timeline established in the <history>.\n14. If a date is provided: Use the provided date.\n15. The outline can include quotes from the named entities where applicable.\n16. Do not repeat the information from the previous events from the <history>.\n17. Refer to all named entities (the new named entities and the known named entities) by their full \"name\" property. DO NOT refer to the named entities using the ID.\n18. Make sure that you refer to all named entities within each storyitem per full name at least once. DO NOT use pronouns to refer to a named entity from the previous story item.\n19. Think about the content that is appropriate for the event summary given the genre, provided history: Think about which dimensions align with all of those, and sound like a realistic event.\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<date>year-month-day</date>\n<outline>\n<storyitem>First story item</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Second story item</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Third story item</storyitem>\n...\n</outline>\n</results>\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The event must be entirely realistic, even though it is fictional. Do not include any science fiction or fantasy elements. The story should read like a plausible current event.\n- Do not use any galactic events. The fictional world should be similar to our world but not about galaxies or outer space.\n- Each story item must only discuss one fact or subevent. Ensure that each story item is specific, concise, and focused on a single piece of information.\n- Begin your response with <results> and end it with </results>. Do not include any text outside of these tags.\n- Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n- Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n- Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n- Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\nRemember:\nThe outline should center on a fictional but realistic event, keeping its scale aligned with the event summary and provided <history> without exaggerating its impact. Rather than overstating the event's significance, the outline should stay within the scope appropriate to the genre, provided history, and provided summary. When in doubt, focus on detailed, localized developments instead of amplifying global effects.\n\nEnsure that the outline is coherent, follows a logical sequence, and offers a unique perspective on the given event while maintaining consistency with the provided background information.",

The community question-and-answer session lasted 45 minutes and was held in a meeting room at {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s training ground. The meeting took place in {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s smaller conference room, which seats up to 20 people and features a whiteboard and a wall-mounted timetable of the upcoming preseason schedule. The session was timed to avoid interfering with first-team training hours and concluded promptly at 11:45 BST to allow coaching staff to begin pitch work at noon. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} told attendees that he remained willing to engage with supporters and to participate in community-facing activities organised by {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} gave examples of past community activities he had taken part in, noting recent school visits and a local youth-clinic he ran last spring, and said he would continue similar outreach while balancing preseason preparations. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} announced a schedule of weekly open coaching sessions for promoted academy players to be held at {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s training ground beginning the week commencing 2025-08-04. The announced weekly coaching sessions were scheduled for Tuesday evenings at 18:00 BST and Saturday mornings at 09:00 BST, with each session planned to last around 75 minutes and to focus on position-specific drills and conditioning. {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} indicated the sessions would be limited to players on first-year development contracts and that the academy manager would confirm final participant lists one week before the first session. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} said {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would publish the coaching session times and participant eligibility criteria on the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} website by 2025-08-02. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} added that the published notice would include an online sign-up form, a parental-consent template for under-18 players, and a contact email for the academy manager where eligibility queries could be directed. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} asked how {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} would be integrated into first-team training and whether the planned coaching sessions would support that transition. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} requested clarification on whether {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} would be phased into full-contact sessions immediately or given a tailored programme during his first two weeks with the senior squad to ease the transition. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} also asked whether {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} intended to assign a specific senior player or coach to mentor {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} during his initial integration period. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} said {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would circulate a brief summary of the meeting to season-ticket holders and local members. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} confirmed the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} planned to email the summary to its approximate 1,200 subscribed members and to post a short notice on the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3}'s website within 48 hours of the meeting. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} added that the circulated summary would exclude any matters both parties agreed were confidential and would invite members to submit follow-up questions for a potential future open forum. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} declined to answer contractual and budgetary questions during the session and advised that such inquiries should be directed to {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team and the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} said he had been briefed by {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} not to discuss commercially sensitive matters and suggested that the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} forward specific document requests to the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team for formal handling. All participants agreed to seek formal guidance from the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office on what contractual information {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} could publish publicly following the meeting. Attendees agreed that {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would prepare a short list of precise data items it wished the compliance office to consider and that both the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} and {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would jointly submit the request for written guidance. All participants set a target to follow up within seven calendar days by jointly emailing the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office to request written guidance on the specific categories of contractual and budgetary information discussed at the session.</outline></event>"
