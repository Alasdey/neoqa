  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with creating fictional entities based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate detailed, coherent, and realistic descriptions for new locations, persons, organizations, products, art, buildings, events, and miscellaneous entities. \nFollow these instructions carefully:\n\n1.

Carefully read the provided outline:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\nBased on the information provided, create detailed descriptions for each new entity following these guidelines:\n\nGeneral instructions:\n- Ensure all created entities are entirely fictional and not similar to any real or known fictional entities.\n- Maintain realism and coherence with the provided outline and other entities.\n- Create a believable and consistent fictional world that aligns with the context of the outline.\n- For entity descriptions, focus on providing a solid background that remains valid throughout the story, rather than basing it centrally on the outline itself.\n- Develop well-rounded entities with backgrounds and characteristics that can support various potential story developments beyond the specific outline provided.\n- Strictly derive all entities from the outline. Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the outline.\n- Do not alter the name of the entities.\n- Some properties (e.g., place, city, country, spouse, architect, country, nationality) must be filled with named entities. Make sure to use FICTIONAL named entities ( fictional places, cities, countries, spouse names, architects, countries, nationalities, etc.). Check if you should use one of the existing fictional named entities (from <new_entity_names> and <existing_entities>) or create a fictional name instead. DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic. If global impact isn\u2019t necessary, adjust the details to be more modest and appropriate.\n\nSpecific instructions for each entity type:\n\n1.

Club|ORGANIZATION-1}.\n{Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} introduced the session by explaining the format and by stating that the session would follow a moderated Q&A structure with predetermined topics to keep the discussion focused.\nThe community question-and-answer session lasted 45 minutes and was held in a meeting room at {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s training ground.\nThe meeting took place in {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s smaller conference room, which seats up to 20 people and features a whiteboard and a wall-mounted timetable of the upcoming preseason schedule.\nThe session was timed to avoid interfering with first-team training hours and concluded promptly at 11:45 BST to allow coaching staff to begin pitch work at noon.\n{Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} told attendees that he remained willing to engage with supporters and to participate in community-facing activities organised by {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}.\n{Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} gave examples of past community activities he had taken part in, noting recent school visits and a local youth-clinic he ran last spring, and said he would continue similar outreach while balancing preseason preparations.\n{Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} announced a schedule of weekly open coaching sessions for promoted academy players to be held at {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s training ground beginning the week commencing 2025-08-04.\nThe announced weekly coaching sessions were scheduled for Tuesday evenings at 18:00 BST and Saturday mornings at 09:00 BST, with each session planned to last around 75 minutes and to focus on position-specific drills and conditioning.\n{Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} indicated the sessions would be limited to players on first-year development contracts and that the academy manager would confirm final participant lists one week before the first session.\n{Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} said {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would publish the coaching session times and participant eligibility criteria on the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} website by 2025-08-02.\n{Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} added that the published notice would include an online sign-up form, a parental-consent template for under-18 players, and a contact email for the academy manager where eligibility queries could be directed.\n{Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} asked how {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} would be integrated into first-team training and whether the planned coaching sessions would support that transition.\n{Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} requested clarification on whether {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} would be phased into full-contact sessions immediately or given a tailored programme during his first two weeks with the senior squad to ease the transition.\n{Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} also asked whether {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} intended to assign a specific senior player or coach to mentor {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} during his initial integration period.\n{Priya Sander|PERSON-6} said {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would circulate a brief summary of the meeting to season-ticket holders and local members.\n{Priya Sander|PERSON-6} confirmed the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} planned to email the summary to its approximate 1,200 subscribed members and to post a short notice on the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3}'s website within 48 hours of the meeting.\n{Priya Sander|PERSON-6} added that the circulated summary would exclude any matters both parties agreed were confidential and would invite members to submit follow-up questions for a potential future open forum.\n{Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} declined to answer contractual and budgetary questions during the session and advised that such inquiries should be directed to {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team and the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office.\n{Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} said he had been briefed by {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} not to discuss commercially sensitive matters and suggested that the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} forward specific document requests to the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team for formal handling.\nAll participants agreed to seek formal guidance from the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office on what contractual information {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} could publish publicly following the meeting.\nAttendees agreed that {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would prepare a short list of precise data items it wished the compliance office to consider and that both the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} and {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would jointly submit the request for written guidance.\nAll participants set a target to follow up within seven calendar days by jointly emailing the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office to request written guidance on the specific categories of contractual and budgetary information discussed at the session.\n</outline>\n\nBased on the information provided, create detailed descriptions for each new entity following these guidelines:\n\nGeneral instructions:\n- Ensure all created entities are entirely fictional and not similar to any real or known fictional entities.\n- Maintain realism and coherence with the provided outline and other entities.\n- Create a believable and consistent fictional world that aligns with the context of the outline.\n- For entity descriptions, focus on providing a solid background that remains valid throughout the story, rather than basing it centrally on the outline itself.\n- Develop well-rounded entities with backgrounds and characteristics that can support various potential story developments

They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic.

The {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1}'s compliance office confirmed registration on 15 July 2025 after {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} submitted the amended squad list and the financial disclosures required under the competition rules. {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} promoted academy back-row {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} to the senior squad as a roster consequence of the {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} contract adjustments. {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} announced that 19-year-old academy back-row {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} has signed a one-year development contract, will train with the first team immediately and will be eligible for selection in the matchday 23.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-07-22</date><outline>{Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} published a public letter on 2025-07-22 requesting a detailed breakdown of {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s 2025 operating budget and the full terms of the {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} contract extension. The public letter was dated and signed by the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} chair and four trustees and stated the request was submitted \"on behalf of season-ticket holders and local members\" who had raised concerns about recent high-profile contract activity at the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} set a 14-day deadline in the published letter and warned it would file a formal compliance complaint with Elmstone Regional Rugby Council if {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} did not publish the requested financial details. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3}'s deadline was specified in the letter as 2025-08-05 and {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} said any formal complaint would be lodged with supporting documentation by email and registered post to the Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance office if no satisfactory disclosure was provided by that date. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} posted the public letter on the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} website and circulated the letter to local media outlets in Harwick-on-Teal. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} confirmed it published the letter at 09:30 BST and distributed PDF copies to local outlets including the {Harwick Gazette|ORGANIZATION-4}, the {Teal Chronicle|ORGANIZATION-5} and {Vale FM|ORGANIZATION-6}, while also emailing a copy directly to the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} communications address. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} specifically requested a salary breakdown for {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} that separates base pay, bonuses and any leadership payments. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} asked that the salary breakdown show gross and net figures, the frequency of payments, any appearance- or performance-related bonuses, details of employer pension or National Insurance contributions related to payments to {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1}, and whether any third-party payments were made. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} specifically requested the terms and conditional criteria for the \u00a320,000-per-season leadership bonus included in the {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} extension. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} requested that the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} supply the precise triggering conditions, measurement criteria and any medical or discretionary exemptions for the leadership bonus, and asked how the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would verify and publish each season whether those conditions had been met. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} requested a disclosure of the one-year front-of-shirt sponsorship with {Northbridge Brewing|ORGANIZATION-2} and an explanation of how the {Northbridge Brewing|ORGANIZATION-2} agreement affects {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s 2025 operating budget. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} asked for the sponsorship contract value to be shown with its payment schedule, any in-kind elements or matchday revenue guarantees included in the deal with {Northbridge Brewing|ORGANIZATION-2}, and a statement of whether sponsorship receipts had been ear-marked against player remuneration or general operating costs. {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} issued a short statement acknowledging receipt of the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} request and said {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would review the letter and seek advice on commercially sensitive information. The {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} statement, posted on the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} website at 11:45 BST, said {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would consult its legal and financial advisers and aimed to provide a considered reply to the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} while balancing contractual confidentiality and regulatory obligations. {Marina Kestrel|PERSON-2}, director of {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}, said {Marina Kestrel|PERSON-2} had instructed {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team to prepare a considered response and to engage directly with the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3}. {Marina Kestrel|PERSON-2} asked the finance team to prepare an initial redacted summary of the 2025 operating budget and to propose dates for a meeting with {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} representatives within ten working days. Elmstone Regional Rugby Council confirmed Elmstone Regional Rugby Council had not received a formal complaint from {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} as of 2025-07-22 and outlined that any formal complaint would be processed under Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance procedures. The Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance office provided guidance to local media that formal complaints must be submitted in writing with supporting evidence, and it supplied contact details for the designated compliance officer who would acknowledge receipt within five working days of a submission. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} issued a brief statement via {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} saying {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} would cooperate with transparency measures and that contractual details should be addressed by {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} and relevant competition offices such as {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance staff. The {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} statement was released through {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s official channels at 14:05 BST and emphasised that {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} was available to meet {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} representatives for a discussion once {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} and competition offices had clarified what information could be shared publicly.</outline></event>",
