hearing.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Dr. Isla Marden moderated the community question-and-answer session on behalf of Harwick Vale Rugby Club.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Dr. Isla Marden introduced the

directed.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Rowan Ferley asked how Jules Renby would be integrated into first-team training and whether the planned coaching sessions would support that transition.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Rowan Ferley requested clarification on whether Jules Renby would be phased into full-contact sessions immediately or given a tailored programme during his first two weeks with the senior squad to ease the transition.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Rowan Ferley also asked whether Harwick Vale Rugby Club intended to assign a specific senior player or coach to mentor Jules Renby during his initial integration period.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Priya Sander said Harwick Community Supporters' Trust would circulate a brief summary of the meeting to season-ticket holders and local members.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Priya Sander confirmed the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust planned to email the summary to its approximate 1,200 subscribed members and to post a short notice on the Trust's website within 48 hours of the meeting.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Priya Sander added that the circulated summary would exclude any matters both parties agreed were confidential and

and advised that such inquiries should be directed to Harwick Vale Rugby Club's finance team and the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>Cormac Halloway

handling.</storyitem>\n<storyitem>All participants agreed to seek formal guidance from the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office on what contractual information Harwick Vale Rugby

The public letter was dated and signed by the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} chair and four trustees and stated the request was submitted \"on behalf of season-ticket holders and local members\" who had raised concerns about recent high-profile contract activity at the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} set a 14-day deadline in the published letter and warned it would file a formal compliance complaint with Elmstone Regional Rugby Council if {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} did not publish the requested financial details. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3}'s deadline was specified in the letter as 2025-08-05 and {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} said any formal complaint would be lodged with supporting documentation by email and registered post to the Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance office if no satisfactory disclosure was provided by that date. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} posted the public letter on the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} website and circulated the letter to local media outlets in Harwick-on-Teal. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} confirmed it published the letter at 09:30 BST and distributed PDF copies to local outlets including the {Harwick Gazette|ORGANIZATION-4}, the {Teal Chronicle|ORGANIZATION-5} and {Vale FM|ORGANIZATION-6}, while also emailing a copy directly to the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} communications address. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} specifically requested a salary breakdown for {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} that separates base pay, bonuses and any leadership payments. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} asked that the salary breakdown show gross and net figures, the frequency of payments, any appearance- or performance-related bonuses, details of employer pension or National Insurance contributions related to payments to {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1}, and whether any third-party payments were made. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} specifically requested the terms and conditional criteria for the \u00a320,000-per-season leadership bonus included in the {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} extension. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} requested that the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} supply the precise triggering conditions, measurement criteria and any medical or discretionary exemptions for the leadership bonus, and asked how the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would verify and publish each season whether those conditions had been met. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} requested a disclosure of the one-year front-of-shirt sponsorship with {Northbridge Brewing|ORGANIZATION-2} and an explanation of how the {Northbridge Brewing|ORGANIZATION-2} agreement affects {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s 2025 operating budget. {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} asked for the sponsorship contract value to be shown with its payment schedule, any in-kind elements or matchday revenue guarantees included in the deal with {Northbridge Brewing|ORGANIZATION-2}, and a statement of whether sponsorship receipts had been ear-marked against player remuneration or general operating costs. {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} issued a short statement acknowledging receipt of the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} request and said {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would review the letter and seek advice on commercially sensitive information.
