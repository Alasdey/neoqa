  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying new named entities from a given outline of a fictional event description. Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<OUTLINE>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures. Note that these lists may be empty or contain partial information:\n\n<entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</entities>\n\nThe definitions with examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural landmarks, and regions.\nExamples: Paris, Mount Everest, California, Amazon Rainforest, Japan, Australia, Australian\n\n- Product\nDefinition: Goods or services created for consumer use or commercial purposes.\nExamples: iPhone, Coca-Cola, Microsoft Office, Tesla Model 3\n\n- Art\nDefinition: Creative works in various forms, including artifacts, ornaments, visual arts, literature, music, and performance.\nExamples: Mona Lisa, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Hamilton (musical)\n\n - Building\nDefinition: Structures designed for human occupancy or use, including residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity. However, this phrase contains the named entity Chicago (location)\n\nExample: \"I bought tickets to go on the Sky Needle, the highest skyscraper in town!\"\n- \"Sky Needle\" is a named entity (building)\n\nExample: \"Aboriginal people from a well known Australian city.\"\n- \"Aboriginal\" is a named entity (Organization)\n- \"Australia\" is a named entity (Location)\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

OUTLINE:\n\nDate: 2025-07-22\n<OUTLINE>\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust published a public letter on 2025-07-22 requesting a detailed breakdown of Harwick Vale Rugby Club's 2025 operating budget and the full terms of the Cormac Halloway contract extension.\nThe public letter was dated and signed by the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust chair and four trustees and stated the request was submitted \"on behalf of season-ticket holders and local members\" who had raised concerns about recent high-profile contract activity at the club.\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust set a 14-day deadline in the published letter and warned it would file a formal compliance complaint with Elmstone Regional Rugby Council if Harwick Vale Rugby Club did not publish the requested financial details.\nThe Trust's deadline was specified in the letter as 2025-08-05 and the Trust said any formal complaint would be lodged with supporting documentation by email and registered post to the Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance office if no satisfactory disclosure was provided by that date.\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust posted the public letter on the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust website and circulated the letter to local media outlets in Harwick-on-Teal.\nThe Trust confirmed it published the letter at 09:30 BST and distributed PDF copies to local outlets including the Harwick Gazette, the Teal Chronicle and Vale FM, while also emailing a copy directly to the Harwick Vale Rugby Club communications address.\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust specifically requested a salary breakdown for Cormac Halloway that separates base pay, bonuses and any leadership payments.\nThe Trust asked that the salary breakdown show gross and net figures, the frequency of payments, any appearance- or performance-related bonuses, details of employer pension or National Insurance contributions related to payments to Cormac Halloway, and whether any third-party payments were made.\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust specifically requested the terms and conditional criteria for the \u00a320,000-per-season leadership bonus included in the Cormac Halloway extension.\nThe Trust requested that the club supply the precise triggering conditions, measurement criteria and any medical or discretionary exemptions for the leadership bonus, and asked how the club would verify and publish each season whether those conditions had been met.\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust requested a disclosure of the one-year front-of-shirt sponsorship with Northbridge Brewing and an explanation of how the Northbridge Brewing agreement affects Harwick Vale Rugby Club's 2025 operating budget.\nThe Trust asked for the sponsorship contract value to be shown with its payment schedule, any in-kind elements or matchday revenue guarantees included in the deal with Northbridge Brewing, and a statement of whether sponsorship receipts had been ear-marked against player remuneration or general operating costs.\nHarwick Vale Rugby Club issued a short statement acknowledging receipt of the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust request and said Harwick Vale Rugby Club would review the letter and seek advice on commercially sensitive information.\nThe club statement, posted on the Harwick Vale website at 11:45 BST, said Harwick Vale Rugby Club would consult its legal and financial advisers and aimed to provide a considered reply to the Trust while balancing contractual confidentiality and regulatory obligations.\nMarina Kestrel, director of Harwick Vale Rugby Club, said Marina Kestrel had instructed the club's finance team to prepare a considered response and to engage directly with Harwick Community Supporters' Trust.\nMarina Kestrel asked the finance team to prepare an initial redacted summary of the 2025 operating budget and to propose dates for a meeting with Harwick Community Supporters' Trust representatives within ten working days.\nElmstone Regional Rugby Council confirmed Elmstone Regional Rugby Council had not received a formal complaint from Harwick Community Supporters' Trust as of 2025-07-22 and outlined that any formal complaint would be processed under Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance procedures.\nThe Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance office provided guidance to local media that formal complaints must be submitted in writing with supporting evidence, and it supplied contact details for the designated compliance officer who would acknowledge receipt within five working days of a submission.\nCormac Halloway issued a brief statement via Harwick Vale Rugby Club saying Cormac Halloway would cooperate with transparency measures and that contractual details should be addressed by Harwick Vale Rugby Club and relevant competition offices such as Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance staff.\nThe Halloway statement was released through Harwick Vale Rugby Club's official channels at 14:05 BST and emphasised that Cormac Halloway was available to meet Trust representatives for a discussion once club and competition offices had clarified what information could be shared publicly.\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures.
