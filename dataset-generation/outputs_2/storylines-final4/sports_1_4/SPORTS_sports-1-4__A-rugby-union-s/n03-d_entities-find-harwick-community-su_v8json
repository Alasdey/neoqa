  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying new named entities from a given outline of a fictional event description. Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<OUTLINE>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures. Note that these lists may be empty or contain partial information:\n\n<entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</entities>\n\nThe definitions with examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural landmarks, and regions.\nExamples: Paris, Mount Everest, California, Amazon Rainforest, Japan, Australia, Australian\n\n- Product\nDefinition: Goods or services created for consumer use or commercial purposes.\nExamples: iPhone, Coca-Cola, Microsoft Office, Tesla Model 3\n\n- Art\nDefinition: Creative works in various forms, including artifacts, ornaments, visual arts, literature, music, and performance.\nExamples: Mona Lisa, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Hamilton (musical)\n\n - Building\nDefinition: Structures designed for human occupancy or use, including residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity. However, this phrase contains the named entity Chicago (location)\n\nExample: \"I bought tickets to go on the Sky Needle, the highest skyscraper in town!\"\n- \"Sky Needle\" is a named entity (building)\n\nExample: \"Aboriginal people from a well known Australian city.\"\n- \"Aboriginal\" is a named entity (Organization)\n- \"Australia\" is a named entity (Location)\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural

residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity. However, this phrase contains the named entity Chicago (location)\n\nExample: \"I bought tickets to go on the Sky Needle, the highest skyscraper in town!\"\n- \"Sky Needle\" is a named entity (building)\n\nExample: \"Aboriginal people from a well known Australian city.\"\n- \"Aboriginal\" is a named entity (Organization)\n- \"Australia\" is a named entity (Location)\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

      "<event><date>2025-07-31</date><outline>{Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} met informally with {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} representatives {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} and {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} at {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s training ground for a moderated community question-and-answer session. The meeting convened at 11:00 BST and included two {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} staff members in attendance as observers: {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s communications officer and the academy manager. The meeting was arranged following an exchange of emails between {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} and {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} earlier in the week and was described by both sides as an initial, informal engagement rather than a formal grievance hearing. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} moderated the community question-and-answer session on behalf of {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} introduced the session by explaining the format and by stating that the session would follow a moderated Q&A structure with predetermined topics to keep the discussion focused. The community question-and-answer session lasted 45 minutes and was held in a meeting room at {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s training ground. The meeting took place in {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s smaller conference room, which seats up to 20 people and features a whiteboard and a wall-mounted timetable of the upcoming preseason schedule. The session was timed to avoid interfering with first-team training hours and concluded promptly at 11:45 BST to allow coaching staff to begin pitch work at noon. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} told attendees that he remained willing to engage with supporters and to participate in community-facing activities organised by {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} gave examples of past community activities he had taken part in, noting recent school visits and a local youth-clinic he ran last spring, and said he would continue similar outreach while balancing preseason preparations. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} announced a schedule of weekly open coaching sessions for promoted academy players to be held at {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s training ground beginning the week commencing 2025-08-04. The announced weekly coaching sessions were scheduled for Tuesday evenings at 18:00 BST and Saturday mornings at 09:00 BST, with each session planned to last around 75 minutes and to focus on position-specific drills and conditioning. {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} indicated the sessions would be limited to players on first-year development contracts and that the academy manager would confirm final participant lists one week before the first session. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} said {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would publish the coaching session times and participant eligibility criteria on the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} website by 2025-08-02. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} added that the published notice would include an online sign-up form, a parental-consent template for under-18 players, and a contact email for the academy manager where eligibility queries could be directed. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} asked how {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} would be integrated into first-team training and whether the planned coaching sessions would support that transition. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} requested clarification on whether {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} would be phased into full-contact sessions immediately or given a tailored programme during his first two weeks with the senior squad to ease the transition. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} also asked whether {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} intended to assign a specific senior player or coach to mentor {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} during his initial integration period. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} said {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would circulate a brief summary of the meeting to season-ticket holders and local members. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} confirmed the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} planned to email the summary to its approximate 1,200 subscribed members and to post a short notice on the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3}'s website within 48 hours of the meeting. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} added that the circulated summary would exclude any matters both parties agreed were confidential and would invite members to submit follow-up questions for a potential future open forum. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} declined to answer contractual and budgetary questions during the session and advised that such inquiries should be directed to {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team and the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} said he had been briefed by {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} not to discuss commercially sensitive matters and suggested that the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} forward specific document requests to the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team for formal handling. All participants agreed to seek formal guidance from the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office on what contractual information {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} could publish publicly following the meeting. Attendees agreed that {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would prepare a short list of precise data items it wished the compliance office to consider and that both the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} and {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would jointly submit the request for written guidance.

The announced weekly coaching sessions were scheduled for Tuesday evenings at 18:00 BST and Saturday mornings at 09:00 BST, with each session planned to last around 75 minutes and to focus on position-specific drills and conditioning. {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} indicated the sessions would be limited to players on first-year development contracts and that the academy manager would confirm final participant lists one week before the first session. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} said {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would publish the coaching session times and participant eligibility criteria on the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} website by 2025-08-02. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} added that the published notice would include an online sign-up form, a parental-consent template for under-18 players, and a contact email for the academy manager where eligibility queries could be directed. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} asked how {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} would be integrated into first-team training and whether the planned coaching sessions would support that transition. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} requested clarification on whether {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} would be phased into full-contact sessions immediately or given a tailored programme during his first two weeks with the senior squad to ease the transition. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} also asked whether {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} intended to assign a specific senior player or coach to mentor {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} during his initial integration period. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} said {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would circulate a brief summary of the meeting to season-ticket holders and local members. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} confirmed the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} planned to email the summary to its approximate 1,200 subscribed members and to post a short notice on the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3}'s website within 48 hours of the meeting. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} added that the circulated summary would exclude any matters both parties agreed were confidential and would invite members to submit follow-up questions for a potential future open forum. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} declined to answer contractual and budgetary questions during the session and advised that such inquiries should be directed to {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team and the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} said he had been briefed by {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} not to discuss commercially sensitive matters and suggested that the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} forward specific document requests to the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team for formal handling. All participants agreed to seek formal guidance from the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office on what contractual information {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} could publish publicly following the meeting. Attendees agreed that {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would prepare a short list of precise data items it wished the compliance office to consider and that both the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} and {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would jointly submit the request for written guidance. All participants set a target to follow up within seven calendar days by jointly emailing the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office to request written guidance on the specific categories of contractual and budgetary information discussed at the session.</outline></event>",
