  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a fictional event summary and its corresponding outline to enrich it with additional NEW specific details. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. Read the provided fictional event summary of the genre {{GENRE}}:\n\n<event_summary>\n{{EVENT_SUMMARY}}\n</event_summary>\n\n2. These are the fictional known entities:\n<known_entities>\n<LOCATIONS>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n</LOCATIONS>\n\n<PERSONS>\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n</PERSONS>\n\n<ORGANIZATIONS>\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n</ORGANIZATIONS>\n\n<PRODUCTS>\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n</PRODUCTS>\n\n<ARTS>\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n</ARTS>\n\n<EVENTS>\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n</EVENTS>\n\n<BUILDINGS>\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n</BUILDINGS>\n\n<MISCELLANEOUS>\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</MISCELLANEOUS>\n</known_entities>\n\n3. Review the outline of previous events that have occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n4. Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to {{NUM_SPECIFIC_SENTS}} novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre ({{GENRE}}) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre {{GENRE}}. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",

Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: 2025-07-31\n<outline>\nCormac Halloway met informally with Harwick Community Supporters' Trust representatives Rowan Ferley and Priya Sander at Harwick Vale Rugby Club's training ground for a moderated community question-and-answer session.\nDr. Isla Marden moderated the community question-and-answer session on behalf of Harwick Vale Rugby Club.\nThe community question-and-answer session lasted 45 minutes and was held in a meeting room at Harwick Vale Rugby Club's training ground.\nCormac Halloway told attendees that he remained willing to engage with supporters and to participate in community-facing activities organised by Harwick Vale Rugby Club.\nCormac Halloway announced a schedule of weekly open coaching sessions for promoted academy players to be held at Harwick Vale Rugby Club's training ground beginning the week commencing 2025-08-04.\nDr. Isla Marden said Harwick Vale Rugby Club would publish the coaching session times and participant eligibility criteria on the Harwick Vale Rugby Club website by 2025-08-02.\nRowan Ferley asked how Jules Renby would be integrated into first-team training and whether the planned coaching sessions would support that transition.\nPriya Sander said Harwick Community Supporters' Trust would circulate a brief summary of the meeting to season-ticket holders and local members.\nCormac Halloway declined to answer contractual and budgetary questions during the session and advised that such inquiries should be directed to Harwick Vale Rugby Club's finance team and the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office.\nAll participants agreed to seek formal guidance from the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office on what contractual information Harwick Vale Rugby Club could publish publicly following the meeting.\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to 2 novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre (Sports) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre Sports. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",
