  "instructions": "You are an AI tasked with creating fictional future news summaries based on provided information. Your goal is to generate plausible continuations of an existing narrative. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. First, you will be given known entities in this fictional world. These will be provided in the following format:\n<known_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</known_entities>\n\n2. Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. Your task is to create {{NUMBER_SUMMARIES}} new summaries that describe future fictional events following the last event from the <history>. These new summaries should be consistent with the existing story and represent plausible continuations or developments of the original narrative.\n\n4. For each summary, create:\n   a. A summary text (a single concise sentence)\n   b. The date on which this fictional next event happens\n\n5. Before starting, check if the history of events indicates specific dates for followup events. Ensure your continuations are consistent with these expected followup events. All your summaries must either concern this event, or happen before this event.\n\n6. Make sure that each summary you generate focuses on at least one of the main named entities from the history of events.\n\n7. Follow these guidelines when creating your summaries:\n   a. Ensure all summaries are fictional and not based on real events or real people.\n   b. Make the summaries sound realistic and plausible as follow-up stories to the previous outlines. \n   c. Think about plausible next events based on the fictional named entities, the history of the past fictional events and the genre {{GENRE}}. \n   d. Create summaries that are unbiased and objective in tone.\n   e. Each summary MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   f. Summaries may focus on different personas or organizations from the provided lists.\n   g. Ensure a balance of positive and negative news stories, developments, and alternative scenarios.\n   h. Consider various dimensions or personas that could be varied when generating diverse summaries.\n\nTry to be diverse in the summaries you generate. Consider different plausible substories and vary:\n- between impact: Try to create various low-impact next events, but you may also at times mix in an event with a slightly higher impact.\n- between directions: Vary between positive and negative story developments. Think about how stories in the {{GENRE}} genre progress in the real-world, NOT in a novel. Provide various realistic alternatives for how the story may progress in either direction.\n- between different key named entities of the fictional story.\n\n8. Output format:\n   - Enclose each summary in <summary> tags.\n   - Each summary must have two child properties:\n     <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n     <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n   - Before each summary, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Output everything within a <results> root node.\n\n9. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n10. Final reminders:\n   - Repeat this process for all {{NUMBER_SUMMARIES}} summaries.\n   - Ensure that each summary explores a different aspect or potential next step of the fictional situation presented in the HISTORY.\n   - Each summary text MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   - The continuations should be diverse in terms of high (at most one), medium and low impact, positive and negative story developments, etc., and can cover different alternatives of how the future event can play out.\n   - Do not enumerate over the summaries.\n   - When brainstorming future event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre {{GENRE}}. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event summaries while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative.\n\nHere's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[This includes the thought process for all summaries.]\n</thought_process>\n\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[Your first summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the first summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n<summary>\n<text>[Your second summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the second summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n[... continue for all summaries ...]\n</summaries>\n</results>",

The meeting convened at 11:00 BST and included two {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} staff members in attendance as observers: {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s communications officer and the academy manager. The meeting was arranged following an exchange of emails between {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} and {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} earlier in the week and was described by both sides as an initial, informal engagement rather than a formal grievance hearing. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} moderated the community question-and-answer session on behalf of {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} introduced the session by explaining the format and by stating that the session would follow a moderated Q&A structure with predetermined topics to keep the discussion focused.

The meeting took place in {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s smaller conference room, which seats up to 20 people and features a whiteboard and a wall-mounted timetable of the upcoming preseason schedule.

All participants agreed to seek formal guidance from the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office on what contractual information {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} could publish publicly following the meeting. Attendees agreed that {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would prepare a short list of precise data items it wished the compliance office to consider and that both the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} and {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would jointly submit the request for written guidance.

Your task is to create 4 new summaries that describe future fictional events following the last event from the <history>. These new summaries should be consistent with the existing story and represent plausible continuations or developments of the original narrative.\n\n4. For each summary, create:\n   a. A summary text (a single concise sentence)\n   b. The date on which this fictional next event happens\n\n5. Before starting, check if the history of events indicates specific dates for followup events. Ensure your continuations are consistent with these expected followup events. All your summaries must either concern this event, or happen before this event.\n\n6. Make sure that each summary you generate focuses on at least one of the main named entities from the history of events.\n\n7. Follow these guidelines when creating your summaries:\n   a. Ensure all summaries are fictional and not based on real events or real people.\n   b. Make the summaries sound realistic and plausible as follow-up stories to the previous outlines. \n   c. Think about plausible next events based on the fictional named entities, the history of the past fictional events and the genre Sports. \n   d. Create summaries that are unbiased and objective in tone.\n   e. Each summary MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   f. Summaries may focus on different personas or organizations from the provided lists.\n   g. Ensure a balance of positive and negative news stories, developments, and alternative scenarios.\n   h. Consider various dimensions or personas that could be varied when generating diverse summaries.\n\nTry to be diverse in the summaries you generate. Consider different plausible substories and vary:\n- between impact: Try to create various low-impact next events, but you may also at times mix in an event with a slightly higher impact.\n- between directions: Vary between positive and negative story developments. Think about how stories in the Sports genre progress in the real-world, NOT in a novel. Provide various realistic alternatives for how the story may progress in either direction.\n- between different key named entities of the fictional story.\n\n8. Output format:\n   - Enclose each summary in <summary> tags.\n   - Each summary must have two child properties:\n     <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n     <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n   - Before each summary, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Output everything within a <results> root node.\n\n9. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n10. Final reminders:\n   - Repeat this process for all 4 summaries.\n   - Ensure that each summary explores a different aspect or potential next step of the fictional situation presented in the HISTORY.\n   - Each summary text MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   - The continuations should be diverse in terms of high (at most one), medium and low impact, positive and negative story developments, etc., and can cover different alternatives of how the future event can play out.\n   - Do not enumerate over the summaries.\n   - When brainstorming future event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre Sports. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event summaries while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative.\n\nHere's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[This includes the thought process for all summaries.]\n</thought_process>\n\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[Your first summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the first summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n<summary>\n<text>[Your second summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the second summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n[... continue for all summaries ...]\n</summaries>\n</results>",

The meeting was arranged following an exchange of emails between {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} and {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} earlier in the week and was described by both sides as an initial, informal engagement rather than a formal grievance hearing. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} moderated the community question-and-answer session on behalf of {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} introduced the session by explaining the format and by stating that the session would follow a moderated Q&A structure with predetermined topics to keep the discussion focused. The community question-and-answer session lasted 45 minutes and was held in a meeting room at {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s training ground. The meeting took place in {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s smaller conference room, which seats up to 20 people and features a whiteboard and a wall-mounted timetable of the upcoming preseason schedule. The session was timed to avoid interfering with first-team training hours and concluded promptly at 11:45 BST to allow coaching staff to begin pitch work at noon. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} told attendees that he remained willing to engage with supporters and to participate in community-facing activities organised by {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} gave examples of past community activities he had taken part in, noting recent school visits and a local youth-clinic he ran last spring, and said he would continue similar outreach while balancing preseason preparations. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} announced a schedule of weekly open coaching sessions for promoted academy players to be held at {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s training ground beginning the week commencing 2025-08-04. The announced weekly coaching sessions were scheduled for Tuesday evenings at 18:00 BST and Saturday mornings at 09:00 BST, with each session planned to last around 75 minutes and to focus on position-specific drills and conditioning. {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} indicated the sessions would be limited to players on first-year development contracts and that the academy manager would confirm final participant lists one week before the first session. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} said {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would publish the coaching session times and participant eligibility criteria on the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} website by 2025-08-02. {Dr. Isla Marden|PERSON-7} added that the published notice would include an online sign-up form, a parental-consent template for under-18 players, and a contact email for the academy manager where eligibility queries could be directed. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} asked how {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} would be integrated into first-team training and whether the planned coaching sessions would support that transition. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} requested clarification on whether {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} would be phased into full-contact sessions immediately or given a tailored programme during his first two weeks with the senior squad to ease the transition. {Rowan Ferley|PERSON-5} also asked whether {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} intended to assign a specific senior player or coach to mentor {Jules Renby|PERSON-4} during his initial integration period. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} said {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would circulate a brief summary of the meeting to season-ticket holders and local members. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} confirmed the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} planned to email the summary to its approximate 1,200 subscribed members and to post a short notice on the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3}'s website within 48 hours of the meeting. {Priya Sander|PERSON-6} added that the circulated summary would exclude any matters both parties agreed were confidential and would invite members to submit follow-up questions for a potential future open forum. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} declined to answer contractual and budgetary questions during the session and advised that such inquiries should be directed to {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team and the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office. {Cormac Halloway|PERSON-1} said he had been briefed by {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} not to discuss commercially sensitive matters and suggested that the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} forward specific document requests to the {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1}'s finance team for formal handling. All participants agreed to seek formal guidance from the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office on what contractual information {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} could publish publicly following the meeting. Attendees agreed that {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} would prepare a short list of precise data items it wished the compliance office to consider and that both the {Harwick Community Supporters' Trust|ORGANIZATION-3} and {Harwick Vale Rugby Club|ORGANIZATION-1} would jointly submit the request for written guidance. All participants set a target to follow up within seven calendar days by jointly emailing the {Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship|EVENT-1} compliance office to request written guidance on the specific categories of contractual and budgetary information discussed at the session.</outline></event>"

Treating it as part of the existing competition avoids creating a >5-word new entry and avoids duplicating the parent entity.\n\nFINAL DECISION:\n- Add only the three new persons that are explicitly named in the outline and not present in the existing <entities> data:\n  - Rowan Ferley\n  - Priya Sander\n  - Dr. Isla Marden\n\nNO OTHER NEW NAMED ENTITIES WILL BE ADDED (the compliance office is omitted for the reasons above).\n</scratchpad>\n<output>\n<person>Rowan Ferley</person>\n<person>Priya Sander</person>\n<person>Dr. Isla Marden</person>\n</output>\n</results>",
