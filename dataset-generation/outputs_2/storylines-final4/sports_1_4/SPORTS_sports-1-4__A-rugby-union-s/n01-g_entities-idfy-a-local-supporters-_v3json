Here is the outline you need to analyze:\n<outline>\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust published a public letter on 2025-07-22 requesting a detailed breakdown of Harwick Vale Rugby Club's 2025 operating budget and the full terms of the Cormac Halloway contract extension.\nThe public letter was dated and signed by the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust chair and four trustees and stated the request was submitted \"on behalf of season-ticket holders and local members\" who had raised concerns about recent high-profile contract activity at the club.\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust set a 14-day deadline in the published letter and warned it would file a formal compliance complaint with Elmstone Regional Rugby Council if Harwick Vale Rugby Club did not publish the requested financial details.\nThe Trust's deadline was specified in the letter as 2025-08-05 and the Trust said any formal complaint would be lodged with supporting documentation by email and registered post to the Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance office if no satisfactory disclosure was provided by that date.\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust posted the public letter on the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust website and circulated the letter to local media outlets in Harwick-on-Teal.\nThe Trust confirmed it published the letter at 09:30 BST and distributed PDF copies to local outlets including the Harwick Gazette, the Teal Chronicle and Vale FM, while also emailing a copy directly to the Harwick Vale Rugby Club communications address.\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust specifically requested a salary breakdown for Cormac Halloway that separates base pay, bonuses and any leadership payments.\nThe Trust asked that the salary breakdown show gross and net figures, the frequency of payments, any appearance- or performance-related bonuses, details of employer pension or National Insurance contributions related to payments to Cormac Halloway, and whether any third-party payments were made.\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust specifically requested the terms and conditional criteria for the \u00a320,000-per-season leadership bonus included in the Cormac Halloway extension.\nThe Trust requested that the club supply the precise triggering conditions, measurement criteria and any medical or discretionary exemptions for the leadership bonus, and asked how the club would verify and publish each season whether those conditions had been met.\nHarwick Community Supporters' Trust requested a disclosure of the one-year front-of-shirt sponsorship with Northbridge Brewing and an explanation of how the Northbridge Brewing agreement affects Harwick Vale Rugby Club's 2025 operating budget.\nThe Trust asked for the sponsorship contract value to be shown with its payment schedule, any in-kind elements or matchday revenue guarantees included in the deal with Northbridge Brewing, and a statement of whether sponsorship receipts had been ear-marked against player remuneration or general operating costs.\nHarwick Vale Rugby Club issued a short statement acknowledging receipt of the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust request and said Harwick Vale Rugby Club would review the letter and seek advice on commercially sensitive information.\nThe club statement, posted on the Harwick Vale website at 11:45 BST, said Harwick Vale Rugby Club would consult its legal and financial advisers and aimed to provide a considered reply to the Trust while balancing contractual confidentiality and regulatory obligations.\nMarina Kestrel, director of Harwick Vale Rugby Club, said Marina Kestrel had instructed the club's finance team to prepare a considered response and to engage directly with Harwick Community Supporters' Trust.\nMarina Kestrel asked the finance team to prepare an initial redacted summary of the 2025 operating budget and to propose dates for a meeting with Harwick Community Supporters' Trust representatives within ten working days.\nElmstone Regional Rugby Council confirmed Elmstone Regional Rugby Council had not received a formal complaint from Harwick Community Supporters' Trust as of 2025-07-22 and outlined that any formal complaint would be processed under Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance procedures.\nThe Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance office provided guidance to local media that formal complaints must be submitted in writing with supporting evidence, and it supplied contact details for the designated compliance officer who would acknowledge receipt within five working days of a submission.\nCormac Halloway issued a brief statement via Harwick Vale Rugby Club saying Cormac Halloway would cooperate with transparency measures and that contractual details should be addressed by Harwick Vale Rugby Club and relevant competition offices such as Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance staff.\nThe Halloway statement was released through Harwick Vale Rugby Club's official channels at 14:05 BST and emphasised that Cormac Halloway was available to meet Trust representatives for a discussion once club and competition offices had clarified what information could be shared publicly.\n</outline>\n\n3.
