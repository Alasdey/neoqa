Possible sentence IDs (all contain Ivo Harlen) are N0-S6, N0-S7 (from event 1) and N1-S6, N1-S7 (from event 2).\n\n1. Inspect sentences for unique information about Ivo Harlen:\n- N0-S6: Ivo Harlen commented that Sera executed the practiced race plan and that her second-half pace sealed the finish. (Coach quote about race execution)\n- N0-S7: Ivo Harlen stated Sera produced a negative split, gave the second 100m time (59.20s), and credited targeted 8x100 race-pace sets in training for the strong finish. (Specifies a particular training set tied to performance)\n- N1-S6: Merrowgate confirmed Ivo Harlen will accompany Sera to a one-on-one evaluation with Nadia Varnell. (Ivo's role at the scheduled evaluation)\n- N1-S7: Merrowgate stated Ivo Harlen will bring Sera's recent training log, official race split sheets, and a short written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets for the evaluation. (Specifies documents he will bring\u2014ties directly to N0-S7's mention of 8x100 sets)\n\n2. Look for cross-event connections forming a multi-hop reasoning chain:\n- A natural, informative multi-hop link connects N0-S7 (coach credits 8x100 race-pace sets for the race outcome) with N1-S7 (the coach will bring a written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets to the evaluation). Combining these two sentences allows questions that require reasoning about which training element the coach credited and which material he planned to present at the evaluation.\n\n3. Evaluate uniqueness / KB overlap:\n- The known-named-entities entry lists Ivo Harlen as a coach, but does not contain the specific statements about negative split times, the coach crediting the 8x100 sets, nor the fact that he will bring the written summary and specific documents to the evaluation. Thus these sentences provide unique, non-redundant details suitable for multi-hop questions.\n\n4. Candidate pairs considered:\n- (N0-S7, N1-S7): Strong semantic overlap (8x100 race-pace sets) and clear multi-hop potential; meets the requirement to cover both events and both include the bridge entity.\n- Other combinations (e.g., N0-S6 with N1-S7 or N1-S6) are possible, but N0-S7+N1-S7 gives the most direct and interesting two-step inference linking credited training work to the documentation the coach will bring.\n\nBased on this, I will produce one selection pairing N0-S7 (event 1) with N1-S7 (event 2).\n</scratchpad>\n\n<selection>\n<ids>N0-S7, N1-S7</ids>\n<explanation>These two sentences both mention Coach Ivo Harlen and connect a specific training element (the targeted 8x100 race-pace sets that he credited for Sera's strong finish in the championship final) with the materials he will bring to the subsequent evaluation (a short written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets).
