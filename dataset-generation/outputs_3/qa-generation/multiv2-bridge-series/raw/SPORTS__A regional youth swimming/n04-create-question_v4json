  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing two sentences about fictional events involving fictional named entities and generating multi-hop questions using a bridge entity. Your goal is to identify specific details within these sentences and create {{NUM_QUESTIONS}} question-answer pairs that require reasoning over both sentences.\n\nFirst, familiarize yourself with the complete storyline outline of the fictional events:\n\n<storyline_outline>\n{{STORYLINE_OUTLINE_TO_DATE}}\n</storyline_outline>\n\nNow, focus on the two selected sentences based on which you must generate multi-hop questions:\n\n<selected_sentences>\n{{SELECTED_SENTENCES}}\n</selected_sentences>\n\nThe bridge entity in these sentences is:\n\n<bridge_entity>{{BRIDGE_ENTITY_NAME}}</bridge_entity>\n\nTo generate multi-hop questions that require reasoning over both sentences, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify information about the bridge entity in both sentences that is unique to these two sentences and cannot be found based on any other information from the provided storyline outline. This information should be as specific as possible, to avoid any ambiguities or overlap with other information from other sentences.\n\n2. To generate a question-answer pair, ask for specific information about the bridge entity from one sentence while describing the bridge entity with information from the other sentence. Make sure that the correct answer is concise and factual. The answer should focus on very specific details that can be described in few words. \n   - Make sure that the question is answerable.\n   - Make sure to ask for short and concise information\n   - Make sure that the way you paraphrase the bridge named entity clearly identifies the bridge entity using the unique information from the selected sentence (and not more)\n   - Ensure that you do not introduce additional ambiguity when paraphrasing: \n        a. If the evidence says that the bridge entity announces the creation of something, it does not mean that the bridge entity created it. Be careful in your word choice to avoid ambiguities.\n        b. Do include specific information (such as the named entity's profession or role) from the <storyline_outline> if they are not explicitly clear in from the selected sentences.\n\n3. Make sure that the information from the selected sentences is sufficient to answer the question with certainty. Your question must not rely on other information that is only communicated in different sentences. If it is important to include additional information that is not included in the selected sentences, add the additional sentence IDs that are needed to the output. \n   - For each of the new sentences, explain the unique information from the sentence that is required to answer the question \n   - For each of the new sentences, ensure that the unique information from the new sentences is required to answer the question with certainty. Refine the question idea if necessary.\n\n4. Do not mention the bridge named entity explicitly in your questions. Paraphrase the bridge named entity using the unique information from one of the selected sentences.\n\n5. Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when having access to the information from BOTH sentences. Make sure that all selected sentences must be considered to answer the question. Avoid using the bridge entity itself as the answer.\n\n6. Ensure that the information that is required from each sentence is unique within this sentence: It can neither be inferred nor extracted from any other sentence within the provided storyline outline. If the question can be answered based on the other information from the storyline outline, increase the specificity of the required details and ensure they are unique to the selected sentences.\n\n7. Verify that your question does not assume any relations that are not clear from the selected sentences. \n   - You can only assume that the bridge entity is identical across all sentences. Other information may not refer to the identical entity. For example, a group of people in one sentence may not be identical to a group of people in another sentence.\n   - Do not assume causality between the selected sentences.\n   If in doubt, rely on the bridge entity.\n   \n8. Compare each specific detail in the question with the selected sentences. Make sure that each detail can with certainty be inferred from the selected sentences. If not, omit or generalize the specific details that cannot be inferred from the selected sentences.\n   - Only focus on the selected sentences!\n   - Correct information that is only known from the <storyline_outline> but not from the <selected_sentences> must NOT be used in the question.\n  - DO NOT assume the profession of an entity when paraphrasing it, unless it is fully clear from the selected sentences!

If you believe you need additional sentence(s), for each additional sentence justify your decision by stating the sentence id, the unique information from this sentence and why it is essential. If no additional sentence is needed, explain why the current selection is self-contained.]\n\nVerification:\n[Draft your question and verify points 4,5,6,7,8]\n\n</scratchpad>\n\nIt is crucial that you adhere to the following criteria:\n- Answering the question is only possible based on the unique information that can be found in the selected sentences.\n- Answering the question requires combining the unique information from ALL selected sentences.\n- The question is specific enough to allow only for one valid answer. There are no other interpretations based on the storyline outline which would allow for a different valid answer.\n- The answer must be complete. \n\nImportant reminders:\n- The sentences describe part of a fictional event. Your questions must address the fictional event.\n- Generate {{NUM_QUESTIONS}} multi-hop questions.\n- Verify the generated questions based on the defined criteria and correct them if necessary.\n- Make sure to be specific in the question when paraphrasing the bridge entity to avoid ambiguities. It must be clear to identify the bridge entity based on the details provided in the question.\n- DO NOT ask for \"specific\" information verbatim.

Make sure that the correct answer is short and concise.]\n\nAdditional sentences:\n[Check if the selected sentences are sufficient to write a self-contained question based on the defined criteria. If you believe you need additional sentence(s), for each additional sentence justify your decision by stating the sentence id, the unique information from this sentence and why it is essential. If no additional sentence is needed, explain why the current selection is self-contained.]\n\nVerification:\n[Draft your question and verify points 4,5,6,7,8]\n\n</scratchpad>\n\nIt is crucial that you adhere to the following criteria:\n- Answering the question is only possible based on the unique information that can be found in the selected sentences.\n- Answering the question requires combining the unique information from ALL selected sentences.\n- The question is specific enough to allow only for one valid answer. There are no other interpretations based on the storyline outline which would allow for a different valid answer.\n- The answer must be complete. \n\nImportant reminders:\n- The sentences describe part of a fictional event. Your questions must address the fictional event.\n- Generate 1 multi-hop questions.\n- Verify the generated questions based on the defined criteria and correct them if necessary.\n- Make sure to be specific in the question when paraphrasing the bridge entity to avoid ambiguities. It must be clear to identify the bridge entity based on the details provided in the question.\n- DO NOT ask for \"specific\" information verbatim. Instead, provide specific details in the question that can be answered with concrete values.\n- While you must ask for very specific information, make sure the answer itself is a short and concise phrase!\n\nFormat your output as follows:\n\n<scratchpad>\n[Your thinking can go here.]\n</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<qa>\n<question>[Your generated question]</question>\n<answer>[The answer based on the evidence sentences]</answer>\n<additional_sentence_ids>[List of additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, if applicable]</additional_sentence_ids>\n<additional_sentence_explanation>[Explain the unique information of each additional sentence that is required to answer the question and justify why it is needed, if applicable]</additional_sentence_explanation>\n</qa>\n</results>\n\nNow, begin the task of generating question-answer pairs based on the provided sentences.
