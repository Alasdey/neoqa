    "SELECTION_EXPLANATION": "These two sentences both explicitly reference Rivermark Lynx and provide complementary, unique facts: N1-S3 gives detailed post-session medical assessment results (zero pain on a 0\u201310 scale, normal bilateral knee/ankle ROM, satisfactory single-leg hop), while N1-S5 records the coach's conditional roster decision (inclusion contingent on a minutes-management plan initially limiting Maya Cortes to under 20 minutes). Together they form a strong bridge-based multi-hop pair linking the club's medical clearance to the coach's minutes-management roster decision, enabling questions that require reasoning over both medical findings and coaching actions. The specific medical results and the exact minutes limit are not present in the known named-entities data, so both sentences are necessary.",
