      "scratchpad": "<scratchpad>\nN1-S4:\n- Time information: A one-on-one evaluation is scheduled \"for 2025-07-22.\"\n- Event date: The event containing this sentence has an event date of 2025-07-16, but the sentence itself gives an absolute future date (2025-07-22) for the evaluation.\nAssumptions:\n- Take the sentence at face value: the evaluation is scheduled on the calendar date 2025-07-22 (no specific clock time given).\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Evaluation date: 2025-07-22 (assumed to occur at some time during that calendar day).\n\nN1-S9:\n- Time information: The selection committee \"intends to review Nadia Varnell's written evaluation within 72 hours.\" The sentence does not state the exact reference moment that starts the 72-hour window.\n- Event date: same event block (event date 2025-07-16) but this sentence gives only a relative interval (72 hours) and no explicit start date.\nAssumptions:\n- The natural reading combined with N1-S4 is that Nadia Varnell's written evaluation will be produced in connection with the one-on-one evaluation on 2025-07-22, and the selection committee's 72-hour review window applies starting on that written evaluation's availability (assumed to be the same day, 2025-07-22).\n- Therefore the latest intended review-completion date is 72 hours after 2025-07-22.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Latest intended review completion: 2025-07-22 + 72 hours = 2025-07-25 (same clock time, three calendar days later).\n- Equivalent duration between the evaluation (2025-07-22) and the latest intended review completion: 72 hours = 3 days.\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None added. Both selected sentences are required: N1-S4 supplies the evaluation date; N1-S9 supplies the 72-hour review window. Removing either would prevent computing the absolute duration between the evaluation and the review deadline.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the duration between the scheduled one-on-one evaluation and the maximum amount of time the selection committee intends to take to review Nadia Varnell's written evaluation. This requires (a) extracting the evaluation date from one sentence and (b) applying the 72-hour review window from the other sentence to compute the span. The question must not include explicit dates so that the solver must extract them from the selected sentences.\n\n- Unique information required from each sentence:\n  - From N1-S4: the date of the scheduled one-on-one evaluation (2025-07-22).\n  - From N1-S9: the selection committee's planned review window (\"within 72 hours\"), which defines the maximum allowed review time after the evaluation/written evaluation.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start point: one-on-one evaluation scheduled on 2025-07-22 (from N1-S4).\n- End point (latest intended review completion): within 72 hours after Nadia Varnell's written evaluation, assumed available the same day as the evaluation \u2192 2025-07-22 + 72 hours = 2025-07-25.\n- Duration between those two points: 72 hours = 3 days.\n</scratchpad>",
      "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nProblems found:\n- The original response correctly computed the duration (72 hours / 3 days) using N1-S4 and N1-S9 and included a derivation. However, it did not include the selected sentence IDs in the <additional_sentence_ids> field of the results. The task required listing any additional sentence IDs if applicable; since the question depends on the two selected sentences, those IDs should be listed.\n- The task instructions also require that if any assumptions are needed to derive absolute dates, those assumptions must be stated in the question. The previous question did not state the assumption that Nadia Varnell's written evaluation is made available on the same day as the scheduled one-on-one evaluation (which was explicitly noted in the scratchpad as an assumption). That assumption is necessary to link the 72-hour review window to the 2025-07-22 evaluation date and must be included in the question.\n\nCorrections made:\n- Added the explicit assumption into the question text: that Nadia Varnell's written evaluation is made available on the same day as the scheduled one-on-one evaluation.\n- Listed the required sentence IDs (N1-S4 and N1-S9) in the <additional_sentence_ids> field.\n- Provided short explanations for why each sentence is required in <additional_sentence_explanation>.\n\nNo change to the computed answer (3 days / 72 hours), as the derivation and arithmetic were correct.\n</scratchpad>",
