  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a complex question-answer pair based on a fictional event outline. Your goal is to create a question that asks about an absolute time span (duration) that can be computed using specific selected sentences from the outline.\n\nFirst, review the complete storyline outline:\n\n<complete_outline>\n{{STORYLINE_OUTLINE_TO_DATE}}\n</complete_outline>\n\nNow, focus on the selected sentences:\n\n<selected_sentences>\n{{SELECTED_SENTENCES}}\n</selected_sentences>\n\nTo create a time-span question based on the selected sentences, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the absolute date or time within each of the selected sentences if possible. If a sentence doesn't provide additional time information, use the event date as time information. Remember that the dates of individual sub-events within each event may differ from the event date. To compute the specific points in time, check if the selected sentences specify any of the following:\n   - Relative time information (e.g., \"six weeks ago\", \"in five days\", \"after two hours\") based on which you can compute a specific point in time\n   - Absolute time information (e.g., \"10:00 am\", \"March 22nd\")\n   - You can always assume that the date listed for each event is known. The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. \n   - If the specific points in time cannot be asserted with certainty but only estimated based on some likelihood, specify assumptions under which you can derive absolute points in time\n   - If the sentences describe durations, list the respective start and end dates/times together with the assumptions\n\n2. Think about the different options of absolute points of time and which time span between them would be most challenging to compute, ensuring that all selected sentences are required to compute the duration.\n\n3. Draft a specific question that asks for the time duration. This question can only be solved if one derives the absolute points in time from each of the selected sentences. The question must always ask about the duration between two points in time. Prefer time durations that differ from the absolute durations of the respective event (if multiple options of different possible ways to compute durations exist).\n\n4. Formulate a precise and correct answer to the question, which must be an absolute duration. Only use the information from the selected sentences and make the question very specific to avoid ambiguities. In the scratchpad, include a derivation of the answer using the absolute dates you estimated before.\n\n5. Ensure the validity of the questions:\n   - Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present.\n   - Make sure that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n   - Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to answer the question and that no other sentence from the <complete_outline> can replace any of the selected sentence in answering the question.\n   - Adjust the question accordingly to fulfill these criteria by making it more specific.\n\n6. Avoid absolute dates or times in your question if possible:\n   - If you needed to make an assumption about when something happened, try to explain it relative to other existing events or information from the <complete_outline>. Try to replace explicitly mentioned dates by anchoring them into some content of the <complete_outline> instead. If necessary, add the additional required sentence ID to your result and explain the unique information of this sentence that is necessary.\n   - Make sure that temporal reasoning is still required in the revised question. Double-check if the temporal information is still essential to answer the question after resolving the absolute dates. Think about different options (like start and end dates) to make sure that one must apply temporal reasoning to answer the question.\n\n7.

The two selected sentences uniquely provide the required dates (evaluation completion date and clinic start date).\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the elapsed number of days between the completion of the evaluation and the start of the scheduled two-week clinic.\n- This requires both sentences: N2-S0 supplies the evaluation completion date; N2-S8 supplies the clinic start date. Neither alone suffices.\n- Avoid mentioning absolute dates in the question; explicitly state the assumption used for counting days (calendar-day difference using the dates given in the sentences).\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Evaluation completion date = 2025-07-22 (from N2-S0).\n- Clinic start date = 2025-08-05 (from N2-S8).\n- Compute difference in days:\n  - Days remaining in July after (and excluding) July 22: July 23\u201331 = 9 days.\n  - Days in August up to August 5 inclusive of the 5th: Aug 1\u20135 = 5 days.\n  - Total elapsed days from 2025-07-22 to 2025-08-05 = 9 + 5 = 14 days.\n- Alternatively, numeric difference: date(2025-08-05) \u2212 date(2025-07-22) = 14 days.\n\nNotes on assumptions:\n- Using calendar-day difference (no times of day used). If a time-of-day were used (e.g., completion at 10:45 a.m.), the elapsed time in hours/minutes could differ; here we compute whole days between the two calendar dates as supplied.\n\n</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the prior response against the task instructions.\n\nFindings:\n- The calculation and derivation are correct: 2025-07-22 to 2025-08-05 is a 14-day elapsed interval using calendar-day difference.\n- The question avoids quoting absolute dates directly and asks for the elapsed calendar days between the two points, with an explicit assumption that those points are to be used \u2014 satisfying the requirement to state assumptions in the question.\n- The answer is concise and precise (\"14 days\") as required.\n- However, the previous \"additional_sentence_ids\" and \"additional_sentence_explanation\" fields were left empty. The checking task specifically asked to list additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected earlier) and to explain the unique information each provides. To be fully compliant with the checking output format and instructions, I should list the selected sentence IDs (N2-S0 and N2-S8) and explain why each is necessary.\n\nNo changes were made to the question, the numeric answer, or the derivation \u2014 only the metadata fields (additional_sentence_ids and additional_sentence_explanation) are populated to reflect the required information.\n\n</scratchpad>",
