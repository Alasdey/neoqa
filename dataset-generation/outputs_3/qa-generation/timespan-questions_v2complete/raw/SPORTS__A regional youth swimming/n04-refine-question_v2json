        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the prior response against the task instructions. The original answer correctly identified and used the times in N4-S1 and N4-S5, computed the reassessment end time, and computed the elapsed interval to the email time. The question avoided stating absolute times and required treating \"approximately\" and \"about\" as exact (an explicit assumption). The computed duration (28 minutes) is correct.\n\nOne minor correction/improvement: the previous response left <additional_sentence_ids> empty. The check instruction requests listing any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected previously). To be explicit and to satisfy the checker's requirement, I will include the two selected sentence IDs (N4-S1 and N4-S5) as required sentences and explain their unique contributions and the necessary assumption.\n\nNo other changes are needed.\n\nSummary of justification:\n- N4-S1 is required to derive the reassessment end time (it provides start time and duration).\n- N4-S5 is required to provide the email send time.\n- The assumption (carried over) that \"approximately 19:10\" and \"about 25 minutes\" are treated as exact values is necessary and was explicitly stated in the original scratchpad; it is retained here.\n\nNo further corrections to the numeric computation or the question wording were necessary.\n</scratchpad>",
