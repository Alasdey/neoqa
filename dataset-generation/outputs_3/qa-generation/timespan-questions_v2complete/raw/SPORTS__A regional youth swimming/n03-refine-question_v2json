No specific time-of-day is provided.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Submission deadline = 2025-07-30 (calendar date; time-of-day unspecified).\n\nN3-S7:\n- Time information: Ivo Harlen provided a provisional arrival time of \"the evening of 2025-08-04\" and repeated that the submission on 2025-07-30 would include the clinician's clearance document and accommodation preference.\n- Event date: 2025-07-28 (event date), but the sentence specifies absolute future dates 2025-07-30 and 2025-08-04.\nAssumptions:\n- \"Evening of 2025-08-04\" refers to that calendar date (2025-08-04), i.e., arrival occurs during the evening hours of that date. No exact clock time is given.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Provisional arrival date = 2025-08-04 (evening of that calendar date).\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None required. Both N3-S6 and N3-S7 provide unique necessary pieces: N3-S6 provides the submission-by date (2025-07-30); N3-S7 provides the provisional arrival evening (2025-08-04). Both are required to compute the span between the two points.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the elapsed time between the submission deadline and the provisional arrival evening. This requires extracting the submission-by date from one sentence and the arrival date from the other; neither sentence alone suffices.\n\nClarify assumptions to avoid ambiguity in calculation:\n- Count whole days between the two calendar dates (i.e., from 2025-07-30 to 2025-08-04). Treat unspecified times as calendar dates; compute elapsed days as date difference (not inclusive count).\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Submission date: 2025-07-30\n- Arrival date: 2025-08-04 (evening)\nCompute days elapsed from 2025-07-30 to 2025-08-04:\n  2025-07-30 -> 2025-07-31 = 1 day\n  2025-07-31 -> 2025-08-01 = 2 days\n  2025-08-01 -> 2025-08-02 = 3 days\n  2025-08-02 -> 2025-08-03 = 4 days\n  2025-08-03 -> 2025-08-04 = 5 days\nElapsed time = 5 days.\n\n</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.\n\nFindings:\n- The previous response correctly identified absolute dates from N3-S6 (submission by 2025-07-30) and N3-S7 (provisional arrival evening 2025-08-04), stated assumptions, derived the elapsed time (5 days), and formed a question that avoids explicit dates and requires both sentences.\n- The answer \"5 days\" is precise and concise.\n- One minor omission: the final output did not list the selected sentence IDs (N3-S6 and N3-S7) in the <additional_sentence_ids> field. The current task's required output format asks to list any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, including those selected previously. Even if no extra sentences beyond the originally selected are required, the original selected sentences should be reflected there for clarity.\n\nCorrection made:\n- Added additional_sentence_ids with the two selected sentence IDs (N3-S6 and N3-S7).\n- Added additional_sentence_explanation explaining the unique information required from each sentence.\n\nNo other changes to reasoning, assumptions, question, or answer were needed.\n\n</scratchpad>",
