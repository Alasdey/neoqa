Sentences mentioning relative time differences (e.g., \"six weeks ago\", \"in five days\", \"after two hours\"). Try to determine the specific date or time they refer to based on the context.\n2. Sentences mentioning a specific date or time (e.g., \"10:00 am\", \"March 22nd\").\n3. Sentences containing specific details unique to the current event.\n\nYour task is to select tuples of NUM_SENTENCES sentences from which you can derive two specific points in time and compute a meaningful time span (duration).

However, it is preferred to collect sentences that introduce novel time information.\n\nIf multiple events are provided, the sentences must come from different events.
