Both sentences are required: N2-S1 supplies the times but not the date, and N2-S0 supplies the date, so together they allow calculation of the absolute elapsed time.",

N2-S0 provides the date, and N2-S1 provides the start and end clock times; both are necessary to identify full absolute points in time (date + time).\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the elapsed time between the evaluation start and finish. The question must not include the explicit times or dates; the solver must extract them from the selected sentences.\n- Ensure the question requires both sentences: N2-S1 gives start and end clock times but does not state the date; N2-S0 supplies the date. Therefore, both sentences are needed to form the absolute start and end instants.\n\n- For each selected sentence, the unique required information:\n  - N2-S0: provides the calendar date (2025-07-22) and confirms the event happened on that date.\n  - N2-S1: provides the specific start and end clock times (10:00 a.m. and 10:45 a.m.).\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start instant: 2025-07-22 10:00 a.m.\n- End instant: 2025-07-22 10:45 a.m.\n- Elapsed time = End - Start = 45 minutes.\n</scratchpad>",

However, the original \"additional_sentence_ids\" and \"additional_sentence_explanation\" fields were left empty even though the solution relies on the two selected sentences (N2-S0 and N2-S1). The task instructions require listing any additional sentence IDs if applicable and explaining the unique information each provides. To comply fully and make minimal changes, I will:\n\n- Add the two selected sentence IDs (N2-S0 and N2-S1) to the additional_sentence_ids list.\n- Provide an explanation of the unique information each sentence supplies and why both are required to compute the absolute elapsed time.\n\nNo changes to the question or the numeric answer are necessary.\n\n</scratchpad>",
