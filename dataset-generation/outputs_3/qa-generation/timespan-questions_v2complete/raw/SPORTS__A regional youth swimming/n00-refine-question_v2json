Both selected sentences are necessary: N0-S2 provides total time; N0-S7 provides second-100 split. Neither alone suffices to compute the first-100 or the difference between first and second 100s.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Compute the difference in duration between the first 100 m and the second 100 m of the same 200 m swim.\n- Unique information required from each sentence:\n  - From N0-S2: the total 200 m time (to derive first 100 = total \u2212 second 100).\n  - From N0-S7: the second 100 m split (directly given).\n- Frame the question so it requires both: ask \"by how many seconds was the second 100 m faster than the first 100 m?\" This forces using total and second-split.\n\nAnswer derivation:\n- Total 200 m = 1:59.86 = 119.86 seconds (from N0-S2).\n- Second 100 m = 59.20 seconds (from N0-S7).\n- First 100 m = total \u2212 second = 119.86 \u2212 59.20 = 60.66 seconds (1:00.66).\n- Difference (first \u2212 second) = 60.66 \u2212 59.20 = 1.46 seconds.\n</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.\n\nFindings:\n- The original response correctly identified time information from N0-S2 and N0-S7, made explicit assumptions, computed the first-100 split and the difference, and produced a clear question and concise numeric answer.\n- One minor discrepancy: the final output left additional_sentence_ids empty. The task's results block should list the additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, and it was specifically requested in the follow-up to include the selected sentences. The two selected sentences (N0-S2 and N0-S7) are indeed required and should be listed there. Also an explanation of why each is needed should be provided.\n\nCorrections made:\n- Added additional_sentence_ids with N0-S2 and N0-S7.\n- Added additional_sentence_explanation describing the unique information each sentence provides and why both are necessary.\n\nNo other changes were necessary\u2014the question, assumptions, derivation, and answer were all correct and met the instructions.\n\n</scratchpad>",

    "SCRATCHPAD": "<scratchpad>\nN0-S1:\n- Time information: \"The final session closed shortly after 6:30 p.m.\"\n- Event date: 2025-07-12 (from the event header)\nAssumptions:\n- \"Shortly after 6:30 p.m.\" is interpreted as 6:31 p.m. on the event date (a minimal plausible reading of \"shortly after\").\nAbsolute dates:\n- Final session close (assumed): 2025-07-12 18:31 (local time)\n\nN0-S9:\n- Time information: \"Officials posted an updated results PDF to the championship website within an hour and forwarded Sera Lortin's time ... for formal ratification...\"\n- The phrase \"within an hour\" does not state the reference point explicitly. Reasonably, it refers to actions taken after the meet's conclusion (the final session). To answer the time-span question using only the selected sentences, we must assume \"within an hour\" means within 60 minutes after the final session closed.\nAssumptions:\n- \"Within an hour\" means at most 60 minutes after the final session closed.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Latest possible posting time (under the assumptions): 2025-07-12 19:31 (i.e., 60 minutes after 18:31)\n- Earliest possible posting time (under the assumptions): 2025-07-12 18:31 (immediately at close)\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None added. Both selected sentences are required: N0-S1 supplies the session-close time anchor; N0-S9 supplies the posting-time bound (\"within an hour\").\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the maximum possible time span between the final session closing and the posting of the updated results PDF, given explicit assumptions about \"shortly after 6:30 p.m.\" and \"within an hour\".\n- Unique info required from each sentence:\n  - N0-S1: provides the start point (\"shortly after 6:30 p.m.\" on the event date).\n  - N0-S9: provides the upper bound on the delay (\"within an hour\") for posting the PDF.\n- Framing: State the assumptions explicitly in the question so the solver knows how to convert \"shortly after\" and \"within an hour\" into absolute times.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start (assumed): 2025-07-12 18:31\n- Latest posting (given \"within an hour\"): 2025-07-12 19:31\n- Duration = 19:31 \u2212 18:31 = 1 hour = 60 minutes\n</scratchpad>",
