(This is the explicit assumption required because the sentence does not itself state the starting point for the 14-day window.)\n- \"Within 14 days\" means at most 14 calendar days after the start date; the latest possible issuance date is therefore 14 days later.\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Latest possible remittance-notification issuance (end point) = 2025-07-16 + 14 days = 2025-07-30.\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None added. Both selected sentences are required: N1-S0 provides the absolute start date; N1-S3 provides the 14-day window that defines the latest possible end date.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the maximum length of time that could elapse between the federation's formal ratification event and the latest possible issuance of the remittance notification, while explicitly stating the necessary assumption that the 14-day window is counted from the ratification date. This requires using N1-S0 to get the start date and N1-S3 to get the relative 14-day limit \u2014 both are necessary.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start = ratification date = 2025-07-16 (from N1-S0).\n- Latest issuance = within 14 days after start = 2025-07-30 (from N1-S3 assumption).\n- Duration = 2025-07-30 \u2212 2025-07-16 = 14 days.\n</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.\n\nFindings:\n- The previous response correctly identified absolute dates and assumptions: ratification on 2025-07-16 (N1-S0) and \"within 14 days\" (N1-S3) anchored to that date.\n- The scratchpad included the required derivation and explicit assumptions.\n- The generated question does not include absolute dates and requires combining both selected sentences to answer (N1-S0 provides the start date; N1-S3 provides the 14-day window). Therefore the question can only be answered when both selected sentences are present.\n- The answer is concise (\"14 days\") and is a plain time span, as required.\n- No additional sentences were needed; the additional_sentence_ids field is correctly empty.\n\nMinor consideration (not an error):\n- The \"additional_sentence_ids\" field could be misread as expecting the two originally selected IDs, but the instructions state to list any additional sentence IDs required beyond the selected ones. Leaving it empty is consistent with the earlier response.\n\nConclusion:\n- No substantive corrections are needed. I will reproduce the original question and answer in the requested output format, retaining the explicit assumption stated in the question.\n\n</scratchpad>",

Both selected sentences are required: N1-S4 supplies the evaluation date; N1-S9 supplies the 72-hour review window. Removing either would prevent computing the absolute duration between the evaluation and the review deadline.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the duration between the scheduled one-on-one evaluation and the maximum amount of time the selection committee intends to take to review Nadia Varnell's written evaluation. This requires (a) extracting the evaluation date from one sentence and (b) applying the 72-hour review window from the other sentence to compute the span. The question must not include explicit dates so that the solver must extract them from the selected sentences.\n\n- Unique information required from each sentence:\n  - From N1-S4: the date of the scheduled one-on-one evaluation (2025-07-22).\n  - From N1-S9: the selection committee's planned review window (\"within 72 hours\"), which defines the maximum allowed review time after the evaluation/written evaluation.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start point: one-on-one evaluation scheduled on 2025-07-22 (from N1-S4).\n- End point (latest intended review completion): within 72 hours after Nadia Varnell's written evaluation, assumed available the same day as the evaluation \u2192 2025-07-22 + 72 hours = 2025-07-25.\n- Duration between those two points: 72 hours = 3 days.\n</scratchpad>",
