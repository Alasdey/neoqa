Both selected sentences provide the distinct absolute time points needed.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the elapsed time between the two actions described: the review of the ultrasound images and the subsequent repeat clinical exam performed by Dr. Elias Verran.\n- Unique information required from each sentence:\n  - N3-S0 supplies the start time (when the images were reviewed).\n  - N3-S2 supplies the end time (when the repeat clinical exam was performed).\n- Framing the question without giving times/dates explicitly ensures the solver must extract the two timestamps from the two sentences and compute their difference.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start = 08:00 on 2025-08-30\n- End = 08:15 on 2025-08-30\n- Elapsed = End \u2212 Start = 15 minutes\n\n</scratchpad>",

I will reproduce the question and answer, and include the two selected sentence IDs with brief explanations of the unique information they provide.\n\nAssumptions (kept explicit):\n- Both timestamps are in the same local time zone and on the same calendar date (2025-08-30).\n- No timezone conversions are required.\n\n</scratchpad>",

No cross-timezone adjustments are required.\n- The times are exact instants: start = 2025-08-30 08:00, end = 2025-09-06 09:00.\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Start: 2025-08-30 at 08:00 (from N3-S0).\n- End: 2025-09-06 at 09:00 (from N3-S9).\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the elapsed time between Dr. Verran's ultrasound review (the instant in N3-S0) and the scheduled one-week functional review (the booked time in N3-S9).\n- This requires both sentences because N3-S0 provides the start instant and N3-S9 provides the end instant. No other sentence gives both instants.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- From 2025-08-30 08:00 to 2025-09-06 08:00 = 7 days exactly.\n- From 2025-09-06 08:00 to 2025-09-06 09:00 = 1 hour.\n- Total = 7 days + 1 hour = 7 days 1 hour (equivalently 169 hours).\n\n</scratchpad>",
