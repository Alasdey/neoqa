Sentences mentioning a specific date or time (e.g., \"10:00 am\", \"March 22nd\").\n3. Sentences containing specific details unique to the current event.\n\nYour task is to select tuples of NUM_SENTENCES sentences from which you can derive two specific points in time and compute a meaningful time span (duration).
