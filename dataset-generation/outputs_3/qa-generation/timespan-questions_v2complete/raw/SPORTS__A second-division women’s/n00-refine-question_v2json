No explicit absolute time other than it is part of the event.\n- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the event date given for the event containing this sentence).\nAssumptions:\n- Because no time of day is given, assume the announcement happened in the morning of the event date (a plausible interpretation when another sentence says \"that afternoon\" for a subsequent action).\nAbsolute dates:\n- Under the assumption, announcement = 2025-08-29 at 09:00.\n\nN0-S7:\n- Time information: \"The club submitted the roster to league administrators that afternoon and received confirmation of registration from the league...\" The phrase \"that afternoon\" is a relative time referring to the same day as other items in the event.\n- Event date: 2025-08-29.\nAssumptions:\n- Interpret \"that afternoon\" as the afternoon of the event date.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Under the assumption, roster submission and confirmation = 2025-08-29 at 15:00.\n\nAssumptions summary (explicit):\n- The event date (2025-08-29) applies to both sentences.\n- \"Announcement\" occurred in the morning of that event date; for an exact computation assume 09:00.\n- \"That afternoon\" refers to the same event date in the afternoon; for an exact computation assume 15:00.\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None added. Both selected sentences are required: one supplies the announcement occurred (no time), the other supplies \"that afternoon\" relative to the event day.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the elapsed time between the club's announcement of the one-year extension and the club receiving league confirmation of registration, using the event date and the interpretation of \"that afternoon\".\n- Make assumptions explicit in the question (morning = 09:00; afternoon = 15:00) so the duration can be computed unambiguously.\n- Unique required information:\n  - From N0-S0: there was an announcement of the signing (the starting point).\n  - From N0-S7: confirmation was received \"that afternoon\" (the end point and its relation to the event day).\n- The question must therefore require both sentences: without N0-S0 you don't have the announcement as the start point; without N0-S7 you don't have the \"that afternoon\" submission/confirmation that defines the end point.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Announcement (assumed): 2025-08-29 09:00.\n- Confirmation (that afternoon, assumed): 2025-08-29 15:00.\n- Duration = 15:00 \u2212 09:00 = 6 hours.\n\n</scratchpad>",
