The question must be answered by extracting the times from N2-S5 and N2-S9 and converting \"the following morning\" into the next calendar day relative to the event date.\n\n- Unique information required from each sentence:\n  - N2-S5 provides the appointment time (18:00) and the location/time context (Harborfen Diagnostic Centre appointment).\n  - N2-S9 provides that the re-evaluation is at 08:00 \"the following morning\" (relative to the event containing N2-S5).\nBoth are necessary: without N2-S5 we don't know the initial appointment time; without N2-S9 we don't know it is the next morning at 08:00.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start: 2025-08-29 18:00 (ultrasound appointment)\n- End: 2025-08-30 08:00 (re-evaluation the following morning)\n- Duration = End \u2212 Start = 14 hours.\n</scratchpad>",
      "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nProblems found:\n- The original response omitted the selected sentence IDs (N2-S5 and N2-S9) from the <additional_sentence_ids> field in the results. The task-check expects the selected sentences to be listed there (the instructions for this check requested listing selected sentence IDs if applicable).\n- The original question did not explicitly state the assumptions required to convert \"the following morning\" into a concrete time. The task instructions require that assumptions needed to answer the question be stated clearly in the question.\n- Otherwise the original derivation, absolute times, and final duration (14 hours) were correct and compliant.\n\nCorrections made:\n- Added an explicit assumption into the question text: that the 18:00 appointment occurred on the same day referenced in the event and that \"the following morning\" is the next calendar day at 08:00.\n- Listed the two selected sentence IDs (N2-S5 and N2-S9) in <additional_sentence_ids>.\n- Added <additional_sentence_explanation> describing the unique temporal information each sentence supplies and why both are necessary.\n\nNo other changes to the computed duration or derivation were necessary.\n</scratchpad>",
