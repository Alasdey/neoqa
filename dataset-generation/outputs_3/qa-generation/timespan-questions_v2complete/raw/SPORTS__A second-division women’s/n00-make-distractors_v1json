It states this was the club's final roster move before the domestic transfer deadline. No explicit absolute time other than it is part of the event.\n- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the event date given for the event containing this sentence).\nAssumptions:\n- Because no time of day is given, assume the announcement happened in the morning of the event date (a plausible interpretation when another sentence says \"that afternoon\" for a subsequent action).\nAbsolute dates:\n- Under the assumption, announcement = 2025-08-29 at 09:00.\n\nN0-S7:\n- Time information: \"The club submitted the roster to league administrators that afternoon and received confirmation of registration from the league...\" The phrase \"that afternoon\" is a relative time referring to the same day as other items in the event.\n- Event date: 2025-08-29.\nAssumptions:\n- Interpret \"that afternoon\" as the afternoon of the event date.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Under the assumption, roster submission and confirmation = 2025-08-29 at 15:00.\n\nAssumptions summary (explicit):\n- The event date (2025-08-29) applies to both sentences.\n- \"Announcement\" occurred in the morning of that event date; for an exact computation assume 09:00.\n- \"That afternoon\" refers to the same event date in the afternoon; for an exact computation assume 15:00.\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None added. Both selected sentences are required: one supplies the announcement occurred (no time), the other supplies \"that afternoon\" relative to the event day.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the elapsed time between the club's announcement of the one-year extension and the club receiving league confirmation of registration, using the event date and the interpretation of \"that afternoon\".\n- Make assumptions explicit in the question (morning = 09:00; afternoon = 15:00) so the duration can be computed unambiguously.\n- Unique required information:\n  - From N0-S0: there was an announcement of the signing (the starting point).\n  - From N0-S7: confirmation was received \"that afternoon\" (the end point and its relation to the event day).\n- The question must therefore require both sentences: without N0-S0 you don't have the announcement as the start point; without N0-S7 you don't have the \"that afternoon\" submission/confirmation that defines the end point.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Announcement (assumed): 2025-08-29 09:00.\n- Confirmation (that afternoon, assumed): 2025-08-29 15:00.\n- Duration = 15:00 \u2212 09:00 = 6 hours.\n\n</scratchpad>",
      "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\n- I reviewed the previous response and compared it to the task instructions.\n\nProblems found:\n1. The previous response included a clear and explicit scratchpad and computed derivation, which matches instructions. However, the \"additional_sentence_ids\" field in the results was left empty even though the question necessarily depends on the two selected sentences (N0-S0 and N0-S7). The instructions asked to list additional sentence IDs if applicable; at minimum the two selected sentences should be referenced there to show which sentences the QA depends on.\n2. There is a minor tension in the instructions about whether the question should include explicit assumed times. Some parts recommend avoiding absolute times in the question; other parts allow explicit assumptions if needed and require that assumptions be stated. The previous response chose to state assumptions explicitly (09:00 and 15:00) inside the question. This is acceptable because assumptions were made explicit and necessary to compute an absolute duration, but it slightly conflicts with the \"avoid absolute times in the question if possible\" guidance. The user requested minimal changes, so I will keep the explicit assumptions but note this choice.\n3. The previous response did not list the selected sentence IDs under \"additional_sentence_ids\" and did not explain the unique information each selected sentence provides. The task requires that any additional sentences be listed and explained. Even if no extra sentences beyond the originally selected ones were added, the output should show which sentences are required.\n\nCorrections made:\n- I will reproduce the QA but include the two selected sentence IDs (N0-S0 and N0-S7) in the \"additional_sentence_ids\" field, and provide a concise \"additional_sentence_explanation\" that states the unique role of each sentence (start point and end point). \n- I will keep the question wording and the answer identical to the previous response (minimal change), since the question explicitly states the assumptions and the derivation is valid and was shown in the scratchpad.\n\nNo other substantive changes are required.\n\n</scratchpad>",
