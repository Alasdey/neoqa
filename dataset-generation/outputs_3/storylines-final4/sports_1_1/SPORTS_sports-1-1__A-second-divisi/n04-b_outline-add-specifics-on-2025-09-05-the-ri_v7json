Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to {{NUM_SPECIFIC_SENTS}} novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre ({{GENRE}}) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre {{GENRE}}. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details.

Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to 1 novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre (Sports) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre Sports. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",

The club published the extension in an official press release on the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} website and social channels and completed the paperwork at the team's training facility with the head coach and general manager present. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} registered contract terms that reduce {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1}'s base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for the one-year extension. The recorded incentive structure includes per-appearance fees, stepped bonuses for reaching specific minutes thresholds in individual games and incremental payments tied to appearing in a target proportion of regular-season fixtures. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} completed a club medical assessment and monitored return-to-play program overseen by {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} after an injury layoff last season. The medical assessment consisted of strength and conditioning benchmarks, on-court movement and shooting tests and cardiovascular screening administered over a short monitoring period, with the club medical staff clearing {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} to progress into full-team contact training. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} filed the finalized roster that includes {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} with league administrators ahead of the domestic transfer deadline to secure the squad for the opening fixtures.

    "HISTORY_XML": "<event><date>2025-08-29</date><outline>{Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} announced the signing of a one-year contract extension with veteran point guard {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} as their final roster move before the domestic transfer deadline. The club published the extension in an official press release on the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} website and social channels and completed the paperwork at the team's training facility with the head coach and general manager present. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} registered contract terms that reduce {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1}'s base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for the one-year extension. The recorded incentive structure includes per-appearance fees, stepped bonuses for reaching specific minutes thresholds in individual games and incremental payments tied to appearing in a target proportion of regular-season fixtures. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} completed a club medical assessment and monitored return-to-play program overseen by {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} after an injury layoff last season. The medical assessment consisted of strength and conditioning benchmarks, on-court movement and shooting tests and cardiovascular screening administered over a short monitoring period, with the club medical staff clearing {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} to progress into full-team contact training. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} filed the finalized roster that includes {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} with league administrators ahead of the domestic transfer deadline to secure the squad for the opening fixtures. The club submitted the roster to league administrators that afternoon and received confirmation of registration from the league, ensuring {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} is officially eligible for selection when the team begins competition. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} issued a short statement through {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} expressing commitment to earn playing time and to meet the incentives specified in the new contract. In the club-released statement {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} said, \"I'm focused on earning my minutes, getting fully fit and doing whatever it takes to help {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} compete this season.\"</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-08-29</date><outline>{Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} completed a supervised full-contact training session without setbacks on 2025-08-29 observed by {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical and coaching staff. The full-contact training session lasted approximately 75 minutes at the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} training facility in Harborfen and included controlled live scrimmage periods designed to replicate match contact situations. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff reported no acute pain or functional limitations for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} in post-session assessments. Post-session assessments by the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical team recorded zero on a standard 0\u201310 pain scale, normal bilateral range-of-motion in the knee and ankle, and satisfactory single-leg hop performance during functional testing. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} head coach placed {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} on the available-for-selection list for the season opener after consulting with {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} head coach noted that inclusion on the available-for-selection list is contingent on following a minutes-management plan that will initially limit {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} to a planned rotation of under 20 minutes while monitoring match response. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} submitted a match-day availability notice to league administrators naming {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} as eligible for selection for the season opener. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} submitted the match-day availability notice through the league's official portal and received an automated confirmation receipt from league administrators confirming the submission. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} told assembled media, \"I'm ready to contribute under the minutes plan the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} sets,\" after the training session. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} spoke to reporters outside the main court, smiling and accompanied by the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} physiotherapist, and added that {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} plans to focus on defensive intensity and on-court leadership while adhering to {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1}'s minutes plan.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-08-29</date><outline>{Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff recorded mild swelling in the right knee of {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} during a pre-match physical assessment on 2025-08-29. The {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} physiotherapist recorded a mid-patellar girth difference of approximately 1.4 cm when comparing the right knee to the left and noted a small suprapatellar fluid wave on bedside palpation at about 17:10 local time. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff withdrew {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} from the finalized match-day roster following the pre-match assessment on 2025-08-29. The {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} head of medical services informed the head coach and submitted the formal withdrawal through the league match-day change portal at 17:25, with arena match officials informed shortly thereafter. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff scheduled same-day diagnostic ultrasound imaging for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} at {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} on 2025-08-29. The {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} appointment was booked for 18:00 and the imaging request specified a focused musculoskeletal ultrasound of the patellofemoral region including longitudinal and transverse views and Doppler assessment to evaluate for effusion or tendon pathology. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff administered a single oral anti-inflammatory dose and applied an ice-compression protocol to {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} while awaiting ultrasound results on 2025-08-29. The {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} physiotherapist administered 400 mg of {ibuprofen|PRODUCT-1} orally and applied a pneumatic cold-compression cuff set to approximately 6\u00b0C in 20-minute cycles while recording pre- and post-treatment pain scores on a 0\u201310 scale. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} scheduled an overnight re-evaluation for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} with {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} at {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} to determine her short-term availability for selection. The re-evaluation with {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} was scheduled for 08:00 the following morning and was planned to include a repeat clinical examination, review of the ultrasound images, standardized knee range-of-motion measurements, and a documented minutes-management recommendation to be communicated to the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} coaching staff after the assessment.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-08-30</date><outline>At 08:00 on 2025-08-30 {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} reviewed the focused musculoskeletal ultrasound images supplied by {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2}. {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} recorded a small anechoic suprapatellar effusion on the images measuring approximately 7\u20139 mm in depth, noted intact patellar and quadriceps tendon continuity, and observed no focal Doppler hyperemia suggestive of active tendinopathy. At 08:15 on 2025-08-30 {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} performed a repeat clinical examination and documented standardized knee range-of-motion and symptom scores for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1}. {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} documented active knee extension of 0\u00b0 and flexion to 135\u00b0 bilaterally, a resting visual analogue pain score of 1/10 rising to 2/10 with single-leg squat provocation, and stable anterior drawer and Lachman tests with no joint-line tenderness. At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} cleared {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10\u201312 minutes. The minutes cap was defined as total in-game time per match for the immediate fixtures, to be delivered in no more than two separate stints and with coaching instructed to minimise prolonged high-intensity defensive minutes during each appearance. On 2025-08-30 {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} instructed the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical team to perform daily symptom checks for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} before and after training and match activity. {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} asked the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} physiotherapist to record a pre- and post-activity 0\u201310 pain score, a brief patellar girth measure, a 30-second single-leg balance assessment, and any analgesic use, and to upload these entries to the club medical portal within two hours of each check. On 2025-08-30 {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} scheduled a one-week functional review at {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} to reassess load tolerance for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} and notified {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} coaching staff of the plan. The one-week functional review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} and will include repeat targeted ultrasound, standardized isokinetic quadriceps/hamstring strength testing and a monitored five-minute on-court conditioning set to determine criteria for incremental minutes increases.</outline></event>",
