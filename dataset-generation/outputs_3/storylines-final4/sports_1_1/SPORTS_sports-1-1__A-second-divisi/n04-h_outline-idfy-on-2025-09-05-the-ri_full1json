In the club-released statement {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} said, \"I'm focused on earning my minutes, getting fully fit and doing whatever it takes to help {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} compete this season.\"</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-08-29</date><outline>{Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} completed a supervised full-contact training session without setbacks on 2025-08-29 observed by {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical and coaching staff. The full-contact training session lasted approximately 75 minutes at the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} training facility in Harborfen and included controlled live scrimmage periods designed to replicate match contact situations. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff reported no acute pain or functional limitations for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} in post-session assessments. Post-session assessments by the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical team recorded zero on a standard 0\u201310 pain scale, normal bilateral range-of-motion in the knee and ankle, and satisfactory single-leg hop performance during functional testing. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} head coach placed {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} on the available-for-selection list for the season opener after consulting with {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} head coach noted that inclusion on the available-for-selection list is contingent on following a minutes-management plan that will initially limit {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} to a planned rotation of under 20 minutes while monitoring match response. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} submitted a match-day availability notice to league administrators naming {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} as eligible for selection for the season opener. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} submitted the match-day availability notice through the league's official portal and received an automated confirmation receipt from league administrators confirming the submission. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} told assembled media, \"I'm ready to contribute under the minutes plan the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} sets,\" after the training session. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} spoke to reporters outside the main court, smiling and accompanied by the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} physiotherapist, and added that {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} plans to focus on defensive intensity and on-court leadership while adhering to {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1}'s minutes plan.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-08-29</date><outline>{Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff recorded mild swelling in the right knee of {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} during a pre-match physical assessment on 2025-08-29. The {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} physiotherapist recorded a mid-patellar girth difference of approximately 1.4 cm when comparing the right knee to the left and noted a small suprapatellar fluid wave on bedside palpation at about 17:10 local time. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff withdrew {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} from the finalized match-day roster following the pre-match assessment on 2025-08-29. The {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} head of medical services informed the head coach and submitted the formal withdrawal through the league match-day change portal at 17:25, with arena match officials informed shortly thereafter. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff scheduled same-day diagnostic ultrasound imaging for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} at {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} on 2025-08-29. The {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} appointment was booked for 18:00 and the imaging request specified a focused musculoskeletal ultrasound of the patellofemoral region including longitudinal and transverse views and Doppler assessment to evaluate for effusion or tendon pathology. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff administered a single oral anti-inflammatory dose and applied an ice-compression protocol to {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} while awaiting ultrasound results on 2025-08-29. The {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} physiotherapist administered 400 mg of {ibuprofen|PRODUCT-1} orally and applied a pneumatic cold-compression cuff set to approximately 6\u00b0C in 20-minute cycles while recording pre- and post-treatment pain scores on a 0\u201310 scale. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} scheduled an overnight re-evaluation for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} with {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} at {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} to determine her short-term availability for selection. The re-evaluation with {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} was scheduled for 08:00 the following morning and was planned to include a repeat clinical examination, review of the ultrasound images, standardized knee range-of-motion measurements, and a documented minutes-management recommendation to be communicated to the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} coaching staff after the assessment.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-08-30</date><outline>At 08:00 on 2025-08-30 {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} reviewed the focused musculoskeletal ultrasound images supplied by {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2}. {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} recorded a small anechoic suprapatellar effusion on the images measuring approximately 7\u20139 mm in depth, noted intact patellar and quadriceps tendon continuity, and observed no focal Doppler hyperemia suggestive of active tendinopathy. At 08:15 on 2025-08-30 {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} performed a repeat clinical examination and documented standardized knee range-of-motion and symptom scores for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1}. {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} documented active knee extension of 0\u00b0 and flexion to 135\u00b0 bilaterally, a resting visual analogue pain score of 1/10 rising to 2/10 with single-leg squat provocation, and stable anterior drawer and Lachman tests with no joint-line tenderness. At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} cleared {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10\u201312 minutes. The minutes cap was defined as total in-game time per match for the immediate fixtures, to be delivered in no more than two separate stints and with coaching instructed to minimise prolonged high-intensity defensive minutes during each appearance. On 2025-08-30 {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} instructed the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical team to perform daily symptom checks for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} before and after training and match activity. {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} asked the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} physiotherapist to record a pre- and post-activity 0\u201310 pain score, a brief patellar girth measure, a 30-second single-leg balance assessment, and any analgesic use, and to upload these entries to the club medical portal within two hours of each check. On 2025-08-30 {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} scheduled a one-week functional review at {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} to reassess load tolerance for {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} and notified {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} coaching staff of the plan. The one-week functional review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} and will include repeat targeted ultrasound, standardized isokinetic quadriceps/hamstring strength testing and a monitored five-minute on-court conditioning set to determine criteria for incremental minutes increases.</outline></event>",
