  "instructions": "You are an AI tasked with creating alternative fictional future news summaries based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate summaries of plausible alternative continuations of an existing narrative. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. First, you will be given known entities in this fictional world:\n\n<known_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</known_entities>\n\n2. Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>{{CONTINUATION_TEXT}}</text>\n<date>{{CONTINUATION_DATE}}</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create {{NUM_ALTERNATIVES}} contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre {{GENRE}}. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>The Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation issued a 2025-07-30 remittance notification confirming the one-time honorarium was processed to Merrowgate Development Squad's administrative account for Sera Lortin.</text>\n<date>2025-07-30</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create 3 contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre Sports. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

The notification was sent in a 10:15 a.m. email from {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s administrative officer to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s selection coordinator and described the issue as minor left-shoulder tenderness that first materialized after a timed interval set on 2025-07-25 and has been managed with ice and modified training since then. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} requested that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} be permitted to attend the 2025-08-05 regional skills clinic for classroom and video-review sessions only, deferring {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s in-pool training pending reassessment. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s request specified that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} would attend only non-pool activities including daily video-review sessions in the clinic classroom and prescribed dryland/core-strength work supervised by {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} staff, and that {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} offered to have its physiotherapist available for on-site reassessment if required by the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} acknowledged {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s request and stated the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} requires a clinician's medical clearance before approving {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s classroom-only participation. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s acknowledgement, issued by email from the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s selection coordinator, specified that the required clinician's medical clearance must be provided in writing by an accredited sports physician or chartered physiotherapist and include a clinical diagnosis, current functional limitations, and any recommended restrictions for the clinic period. {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} confirmed that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will accompany {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} to the clinic and that {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} will submit {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s medical clearance and arrival information to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} by 2025-07-30. In his confirmation {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} stated he would act as {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s team guardian at the clinic, provided a provisional arrival time of the evening of 2025-08-04, supplied a direct mobile contact for emergency use, and said the {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} submission on 2025-07-30 would include the clinician's clearance document and {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s accommodation preference. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} asked {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} to reserve the on-site classroom for {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s video-review sessions pending receipt of the required medical clearance from {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} placed a provisional hold on the clinic classroom for the 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 period and confirmed the room's AV setup includes a ceiling-mounted projector and a laptop playback station compatible with high-frame-rate video files, with seating arranged for up to 20 people pending the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s final approval.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-08-04</date><outline>{Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} physiotherapist {Rowan Myles|PERSON-4} conducted an on-site reassessment of {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} at {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} on the evening of 2025-08-04. The reassessment began at approximately 19:10 local time, lasted about 25 minutes, and included recorded range-of-motion measurements, resisted shoulder tests and a documented pain-on-load rating of 4/10 for the left shoulder. {Rowan Myles|PERSON-4} issued a same-day written medical clearance restricting {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} to classroom and dryland sessions only and advising that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} must not undertake in-pool activity for the clinic period. The same-day written clearance, signed and dated by {Rowan Myles|PERSON-4}, specified a provisional diagnosis of left subacromial tendinopathy, a no-pool restriction for the two-week clinic period, and recommended supervised rotator-cuff strengthening and twice-daily ice as part of the dryland programme. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} forwarded {Rowan Myles|PERSON-4}'s written medical clearance to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} by email on the evening of 2025-08-04; {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} had previously aimed to submit clearance by 2025-07-30 but scheduling required the physiotherapist reassessment to occur on 2025-08-04, so the clearance was sent same-day after that assessment. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} sent the clearance as a PDF attachment titled \"{S_Lortin_Clearance_20250804.pdf|MISCELLANEOUS-1}\" in a 20:03 email to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} selection coordinator and included {Rowan Myles|PERSON-4}'s direct mobile number for same-day follow-up.
