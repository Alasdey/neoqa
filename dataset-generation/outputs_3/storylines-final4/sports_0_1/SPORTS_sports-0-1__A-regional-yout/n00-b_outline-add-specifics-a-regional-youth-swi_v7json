The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun.
