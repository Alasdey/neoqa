Review the outline of previous events that have occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n4. Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to {{NUM_SPECIFIC_SENTS}} novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre ({{GENRE}}) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre {{GENRE}}. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",

Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to 1 novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre (Sports) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre Sports. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",

The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} issued a formal ratification letter signed by the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} secretary and updated the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s official performance database to record the 1:59.86 time as effective 2025-07-16. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a small honorarium to be paid to {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} in recognition of the ratified performance. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} said the honorarium is a one-time payment intended to defray travel and incidental expenses, that the payment will be processed via {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s administrative account, and that a remittance notification will be issued to {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} within 14 days. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} scheduled a one-on-one evaluation between {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} and {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}, the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} under-17 head coach, for 2025-07-22. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} scheduled the evaluation to take place at the Valemont Sports Council Building's coaching office and assessment pool and allotted a 45-minute slot comprising a 20-minute in-pool technical review, a 15-minute video stroke analysis, and a 10-minute discussion of recent training history. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} confirmed that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will accompany {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} to the one-on-one evaluation with {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} stated that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will bring {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s recent training log, official race split sheets from the championship, and a short written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets for review during the evaluation. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} stated that the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} selection committee will decide on any wider camp invitations after the evaluation with {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}.

The evaluation began at 10:00 a.m. and concluded at 10:45 a.m., with {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3} conducting timed short-pace sets in lane three of the Valemont Sports Council Building assessment pool while a portable high-frame-rate camera recorded {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s stroke for later review. {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}'s written assessment noted that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s second-half pacing is a clear competitive strength. {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}'s written assessment included measured session data, citing three coached 50m closing efforts with an average split differential of roughly 0.15 seconds faster on the closing 50m as evidence of {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s reliable race-closing speed. {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3} recommended that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} be offered a focused two-week regional skills clinic rather than immediate placement in the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} development camp. In the recommendation {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3} specified the clinic should prioritize starts and turns, catch-phase refinement, and daily coached video review accompanied by prescribed dryland core-strength sessions across the two-week period. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} acknowledged receipt of {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}'s written recommendation and confirmed that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will coordinate next steps with the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} stated it would confirm {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s availability, provide the athlete's medical clearance and travel preferences, and aim to forward formal participation confirmation to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} within 48 hours.

The notification was sent in a 10:15 a.m. email from {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s administrative officer to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s selection coordinator and described the issue as minor left-shoulder tenderness that first materialized after a timed interval set on 2025-07-25 and has been managed with ice and modified training since then. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} requested that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} be permitted to attend the 2025-08-05 regional skills clinic for classroom and video-review sessions only, deferring {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s in-pool training pending reassessment. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s request specified that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} would attend only non-pool activities including daily video-review sessions in the clinic classroom and prescribed dryland/core-strength work supervised by {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} staff, and that {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} offered to have its physiotherapist available for on-site reassessment if required by the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} acknowledged {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s request and stated the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} requires a clinician's medical clearance before approving {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s classroom-only participation. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s acknowledgement, issued by email from the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s selection coordinator, specified that the required clinician's medical clearance must be provided in writing by an accredited sports physician or chartered physiotherapist and include a clinical diagnosis, current functional limitations, and any recommended restrictions for the clinic period. {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} confirmed that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will accompany {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} to the clinic and that {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} will submit {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s medical clearance and arrival information to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} by 2025-07-30.

The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} asked {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} to reserve the on-site classroom for {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s video-review sessions pending receipt of the required medical clearance from {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} placed a provisional hold on the clinic classroom for the 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 period and confirmed the room's AV setup includes a ceiling-mounted projector and a laptop playback station compatible with high-frame-rate video files, with seating arranged for up to 20 people pending the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s final approval.</outline></event>",
