The Valemont Sports Council Building was used previously for evaluation but is not referenced here \u2014 no conflict.\n- The clinic dates and location (2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex) were established in the history and are referenced consistently.\n- The Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation previously requested participant logistics by 2025-07-28. The July 28 email in this outline is consistent with that deadline.\n- On 2025-07-22 Merrowgate Development Squad said it would aim to forward formal participation confirmation within 48 hours (i.e., by ~2025-07-24). The July 28 submission described here is later than that target. This is a minor timeline slippage but not a direct contradiction (the July 22 item used the wording \"aim to forward\" and did not create a firm obligation). It is plausible the club delayed and is instead providing an update on July 28.\n- The medical clearance requirements in the outline (written by an accredited sports physician or chartered physiotherapist with diagnosis, limitations, recommendations) are consistent and do not contradict earlier requirements. Merrowgate offering its physiotherapist for on-site reassessment is consistent with prior offers of medical support.\n- Ivo Harlen's confirmation to accompany Sera Lortin and to provide arrival time and emergency contact aligns with his previously stated role to accompany and coordinate next steps.\n- Brindemoor Aquatic Complex placing a provisional hold on the classroom and confirming AV capability is consistent with earlier mentions of an on-site classroom reserved for daily video analysis.\n\nConclusion:\nNo substantive inconsistencies requiring changes.
