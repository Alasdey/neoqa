  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying new named entities from a given outline of a fictional event description. Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<OUTLINE>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures. Note that these lists may be empty or contain partial information:\n\n<entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</entities>\n\nThe definitions with examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural landmarks, and regions.\nExamples: Paris, Mount Everest, California, Amazon Rainforest, Japan, Australia, Australian\n\n- Product\nDefinition: Goods or services created for consumer use or commercial purposes.\nExamples: iPhone, Coca-Cola, Microsoft Office, Tesla Model 3\n\n- Art\nDefinition: Creative works in various forms, including artifacts, ornaments, visual arts, literature, music, and performance.\nExamples: Mona Lisa, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Hamilton (musical)\n\n - Building\nDefinition: Structures designed for human occupancy or use, including residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity. However, this phrase contains the named entity Chicago (location)\n\nExample: \"I bought tickets to go on the Sky Needle, the highest skyscraper in town!\"\n- \"Sky Needle\" is a named entity (building)\n\nExample: \"Aboriginal people from a well known Australian city.\"\n- \"Aboriginal\" is a named entity (Organization)\n- \"Australia\" is a named entity (Location)\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

In the recommendation {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3} specified the clinic should prioritize starts and turns, catch-phase refinement, and daily coached video review accompanied by prescribed dryland core-strength sessions across the two-week period. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} acknowledged receipt of {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}'s written recommendation and confirmed that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will coordinate next steps with the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} stated it would confirm {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s availability, provide the athlete's medical clearance and travel preferences, and aim to forward formal participation confirmation to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} within 48 hours. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} scheduled the two-week regional skills clinic at {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} to run from 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 and asked {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} to provide participant logistics for {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} requested that {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} supply {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s arrival time, emergency contact, and any dietary or accommodation needs by 2025-07-28, and noted the clinic will run morning and late-afternoon pool sessions with an on-site classroom reserved for daily video analysis.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-07-28</date><outline>{Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} notified the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} on 2025-07-28 that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} has reported a minor shoulder complaint. The notification was sent in a 10:15 a.m. email from {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s administrative officer to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s selection coordinator and described the issue as minor left-shoulder tenderness that first materialized after a timed interval set on 2025-07-25 and has been managed with ice and modified training since then. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} requested that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} be permitted to attend the 2025-08-05 regional skills clinic for classroom and video-review sessions only, deferring {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s in-pool training pending reassessment. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s request specified that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} would attend only non-pool activities including daily video-review sessions in the clinic classroom and prescribed dryland/core-strength work supervised by {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} staff, and that {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} offered to have its physiotherapist available for on-site reassessment if required by the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} acknowledged {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s request and stated the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} requires a clinician's medical clearance before approving {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s classroom-only participation. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s acknowledgement, issued by email from the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s selection coordinator, specified that the required clinician's medical clearance must be provided in writing by an accredited sports physician or chartered physiotherapist and include a clinical diagnosis, current functional limitations, and any recommended restrictions for the clinic period. {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} confirmed that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will accompany {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} to the clinic and that {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} will submit {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s medical clearance and arrival information to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} by 2025-07-30. In his confirmation {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} stated he would act as {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s team guardian at the clinic, provided a provisional arrival time of the evening of 2025-08-04, supplied a direct mobile contact for emergency use, and said the {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} submission on 2025-07-30 would include the clinician's clearance document and {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s accommodation preference. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} asked {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} to reserve the on-site classroom for {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s video-review sessions pending receipt of the required medical clearance from {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} placed a provisional hold on the clinic classroom for the 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 period and confirmed the room's AV setup includes a ceiling-mounted projector and a laptop playback station compatible with high-frame-rate video files, with seating arranged for up to 20 people pending the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s final approval.</outline></event>",
