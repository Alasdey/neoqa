  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with creating fictional entities based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate detailed, coherent, and realistic descriptions for new locations, persons, organizations, products, art, buildings, events, and miscellaneous entities. \nFollow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. Review the existing entities (if provided):\n\n<existing_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</existing_entities>\n\n2.

Carefully read the provided outline:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\nBased on the information provided, create detailed descriptions for each new entity following these guidelines:\n\nGeneral instructions:\n- Ensure all created entities are entirely fictional and not similar to any real or known fictional entities.\n- Maintain realism and coherence with the provided outline and other entities.\n- Create a believable and consistent fictional world that aligns with the context of the outline.\n- For entity descriptions, focus on providing a solid background that remains valid throughout the story, rather than basing it centrally on the outline itself.\n- Develop well-rounded entities with backgrounds and characteristics that can support various potential story developments beyond the specific outline provided.\n- Strictly derive all entities from the outline. Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the outline.\n- Do not alter the name of the entities.\n- Some properties (e.g., place, city, country, spouse, architect, country, nationality) must be filled with named entities. Make sure to use FICTIONAL named entities ( fictional places, cities, countries, spouse names, architects, countries, nationalities, etc.). Check if you should use one of the existing fictional named entities (from <new_entity_names> and <existing_entities>) or create a fictional name instead. DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic. If global impact isn\u2019t necessary, adjust the details to be more modest and appropriate.\n\nSpecific instructions for each entity type:\n\n1.

Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the outline.\n- Do not alter the name of the entities.\n- Some properties (e.g., place, city, country, spouse, architect, country, nationality) must be filled with named entities. Make sure to use FICTIONAL named entities ( fictional places, cities, countries, spouse names, architects, countries, nationalities, etc.). Check if you should use one of the existing fictional named entities (from <new_entity_names> and <existing_entities>) or create a fictional name instead. DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic. If global impact isn\u2019t necessary, adjust the details to be more modest and appropriate.\n\nSpecific instructions for each entity type:\n\n1.

The final session closed shortly after 6:30 p.m., with roughly 380 spectators in attendance at the {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1}'s 50-meter competition pool. {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}, age 16, lowered the meet record in the 200-meter freestyle by 0.4 seconds with a time of 1:59.86 in the championship final at the {Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship|EVENT-1}. The previous meet record of 2:00.26 had been set in 2018, and the official timing showed {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} touching the wall 0.35 seconds ahead of the second-place swimmer in the final. The performance by {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} contributed directly to {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} securing the overall team title at the {Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship|EVENT-1}. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} finished the meet with 412 team points, clinching the title by a 28-point margin over the second-place team in a field of 18 squads. Coach {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} of {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} said, \"{Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} executed the race plan we practiced and her second-half pace sealed the finish,\" following the final at the {Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship|EVENT-1}. Coach {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} added that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} produced a negative split\u2014covering the second 100 meters in 59.20 seconds\u2014and credited targeted 8x100 race-pace sets in training for the strong finish. {Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship|EVENT-1} officials updated the official meet results to record {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s new 200-meter freestyle meet record set at {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1}. Officials posted an updated results PDF to the championship website within an hour and forwarded {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s time to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} for formal ratification of the new meet record.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-07-16</date><outline>The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} formally ratified {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s 1:59.86 time in the 200-meter freestyle on 2025-07-16. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} issued a formal ratification letter signed by the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} secretary and updated the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s official performance database to record the 1:59.86 time as effective 2025-07-16. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a small honorarium to be paid to {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} in recognition of the ratified performance. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} said the honorarium is a one-time payment intended to defray travel and incidental expenses, that the payment will be processed via {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s administrative account, and that a remittance notification will be issued to {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} within 14 days. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} scheduled a one-on-one evaluation between {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} and {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}, the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} under-17 head coach, for 2025-07-22. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} scheduled the evaluation to take place at the Valemont Sports Council Building's coaching office and assessment pool and allotted a 45-minute slot comprising a 20-minute in-pool technical review, a 15-minute video stroke analysis, and a 10-minute discussion of recent training history. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} confirmed that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will accompany {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} to the one-on-one evaluation with {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} stated that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will bring {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s recent training log, official race split sheets from the championship, and a short written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets for review during the evaluation. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} stated that the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} selection committee will decide on any wider camp invitations after the evaluation with {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} added that the selection committee intends to review {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}'s written evaluation within 72 hours and will apply the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s published under-17 selection criteria, including objective time thresholds, technical assessment, and coach recommendations, when determining any invitations to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s development camp.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-07-22</date><outline>On 2025-07-22 {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3} completed the scheduled 45-minute evaluation of {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} at the Valemont Sports Council Building. The evaluation began at 10:00 a.m. and concluded at 10:45 a.m., with {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3} conducting timed short-pace sets in lane three of the Valemont Sports Council Building assessment pool while a portable high-frame-rate camera recorded {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s stroke for later review. {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}'s written assessment noted that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s second-half pacing is a clear competitive strength. {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}'s written assessment included measured session data, citing three coached 50m closing efforts with an average split differential of roughly 0.15 seconds faster on the closing 50m as evidence of {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s reliable race-closing speed. {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3} recommended that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} be offered a focused two-week regional skills clinic rather than immediate placement in the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} development camp. In the recommendation {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3} specified the clinic should prioritize starts and turns, catch-phase refinement, and daily coached video review accompanied by prescribed dryland core-strength sessions across the two-week period. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} acknowledged receipt of {Nadia Varnell|PERSON-3}'s written recommendation and confirmed that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will coordinate next steps with the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} stated it would confirm {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s availability, provide the athlete's medical clearance and travel preferences, and aim to forward formal participation confirmation to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} within 48 hours. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} scheduled the two-week regional skills clinic at {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} to run from 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 and asked {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} to provide participant logistics for {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} requested that {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} supply {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s arrival time, emergency contact, and any dietary or accommodation needs by 2025-07-28, and noted the clinic will run morning and late-afternoon pool sessions with an on-site classroom reserved for daily video analysis.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-07-28</date><outline>{Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} notified the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} on 2025-07-28 that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} has reported a minor shoulder complaint. The notification was sent in a 10:15 a.m. email from {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s administrative officer to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s selection coordinator and described the issue as minor left-shoulder tenderness that first materialized after a timed interval set on 2025-07-25 and has been managed with ice and modified training since then. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} requested that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} be permitted to attend the 2025-08-05 regional skills clinic for classroom and video-review sessions only, deferring {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s in-pool training pending reassessment. {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s request specified that {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} would attend only non-pool activities including daily video-review sessions in the clinic classroom and prescribed dryland/core-strength work supervised by {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} staff, and that {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} offered to have its physiotherapist available for on-site reassessment if required by the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} acknowledged {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}'s request and stated the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} requires a clinician's medical clearance before approving {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s classroom-only participation. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s acknowledgement, issued by email from the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s selection coordinator, specified that the required clinician's medical clearance must be provided in writing by an accredited sports physician or chartered physiotherapist and include a clinical diagnosis, current functional limitations, and any recommended restrictions for the clinic period. {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} confirmed that {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} will accompany {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1} to the clinic and that {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} will submit {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s medical clearance and arrival information to the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} by 2025-07-30. In his confirmation {Ivo Harlen|PERSON-2} stated he would act as {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s team guardian at the clinic, provided a provisional arrival time of the evening of 2025-08-04, supplied a direct mobile contact for emergency use, and said the {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1} submission on 2025-07-30 would include the clinician's clearance document and {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s accommodation preference. The {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2} asked {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} to reserve the on-site classroom for {Sera Lortin|PERSON-1}'s video-review sessions pending receipt of the required medical clearance from {Merrowgate Development Squad|ORGANIZATION-1}. {Brindemoor Aquatic Complex|BUILDING-1} placed a provisional hold on the clinic classroom for the 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 period and confirmed the room's AV setup includes a ceiling-mounted projector and a laptop playback station compatible with high-frame-rate video files, with seating arranged for up to 20 people pending the {Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation|ORGANIZATION-2}'s final approval.</outline></event>",
