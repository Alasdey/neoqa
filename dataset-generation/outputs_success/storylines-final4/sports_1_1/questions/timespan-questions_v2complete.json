It is part of an event whose event date is 2025-08-29.\n- Event date: 2025-08-29 (from the complete_outline for the event containing N0-S0).\n\nN1-S0:\n- Time information: The sentence explicitly states the supervised full-contact training session was completed on 2025-08-29.\n- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the event containing N1-S0 also lists 2025-08-29, matching the sentence).\n\nAssumptions:\n- When a selected sentence does not itself include a date (N0-S0), we use the event date listed for that sentence as the date of the described action (per instructions).\n- No intra-day times are given for either action, so we can only determine calendar-day resolution. We assume both actions occurred on their event dates; since both event dates are 2025-08-29, both actions are assumed to have occurred on the same calendar day.\n- We assume no implicit earlier/later ordering within the day can be established from the sentences, so the duration in whole days is 0 days.\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Signing/announcement (N0-S0): 2025-08-29 (assumed from the sentence's event date).\n- Supervised full-contact training completion (N1-S0): 2025-08-29 (explicitly stated).\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None added. Both selected sentences are sufficient under the assumptions above: N0-S0 provides the signing event (date assumed from event), N1-S0 provides the training completion date explicitly.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the time span (in days) between the signing/announcement of the one-year contract extension (N0-S0) and the completion of the supervised full-contact training session (N1-S0).\n- This requires using N0-S0 to identify the signing as occurring on its event date and N1-S0 to identify the training completion date. Without N1-S0's explicit date the question cannot be answered; without N0-S0 the start point is missing. Both sentences are necessary.\n- Make the question avoid citing the absolute date; include an explicit assumption clause that the reader should use the event date for the sentence that lacks an explicit date.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Signing/announcement date (from N0-S0 event date) = 2025-08-29 (assumed).\n- Training completion date (from N1-S0) = 2025-08-29.\n- Difference = 2025-08-29 \u2212 2025-08-29 = 0 days.\n</scratchpad>",

N0-S7 supplies the roster-confirmation event (tied by assumption to 2025-08-29) and N1-S0 supplies the training completion date (explicitly 2025-08-29).\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the duration between the moment the club received confirmation of registration from the league (N0-S7) and the completion of Maya Cortes's supervised full-contact training session (N1-S0).

The outline associates N0 with 2025-08-29, so we take that as the signing/announcement date.\n- The one-year contract extension runs for exactly one calendar year from the signing/announcement date (i.e., from the signing date up to the same month/day one year later). This is the natural interpretation of a \"one-year\" extension for computing an absolute end date.\n- The pre-match physical assessment recorded in N2-S0 occurred on 2025-08-29 and is therefore the reference start point for the interval.\n\nAbsolute dates (based on assumptions):\n- Signing/announcement date (start of extension): 2025-08-29 (from N0-S0 event date)\n- Contract expiration date (one year later): 2026-08-29 (one-year after 2025-08-29)\n- Pre-match assessment date: 2025-08-29 (from N2-S0)\n\nReasoning:\n- The question will ask for the time span between the pre-match assessment (the recorded swelling) and the expiration of the one-year extension that was signed/announced on the same day.\n- Both sentences are required: N2-S0 gives the assessment date; N0-S0 gives the one-year contract length and the fact it was announced/signed (we need its date taken from N0's event date). Without N0-S0 we wouldn't know the contract duration; without N2-S0 we wouldn't know the assessment date.\n\nAnswer derivation:\n- Start = date of pre-match assessment = 2025-08-29.\n- End = contract end = signing date + 1 year = 2026-08-29.\n- Duration = from 2025-08-29 to 2026-08-29 = 1 year.\n- In days (2026 is not a leap year): 365 days.\n\nQuestion framing note:\n- The question will avoid explicit dates and instead state the necessary assumption: that the one-year extension begins on the day the club announced it and that the pre-match assessment occurred on that same day.

No clock time given.\n- Event date: 2025-08-29 (event containing N0-S0).\n\nN3-S9:\n- Time information: The one-week functional review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre.\n- Event date: 2025-08-30 (event containing N3-S9), but the sentence itself contains an absolute date 2025-09-06 at 09:00.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The announcement described in N0-S0 occurred on the event date for that sentence (2025-08-29). No specific time-of-day is given for the announcement; because the question will ask for elapsed days, we treat the announcement as occurring at some time on 2025-08-29 and compute whole-day difference to the scheduled review on 2025-09-06 at 09:00. This yields an integer number of days between the two calendar dates (ignoring hours/minutes within the start date).\n- We assume no other offset (e.g., time zones) is relevant.\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Start: 2025-08-29 (date of announcement per N0-S0 event date).\n- End: 2025-09-06 09:00 (appointment per N3-S9).\n\nDerivation:\n- Count days from 2025-08-29 to 2025-09-06:\n  - 2025-08-29 \u2192 2025-08-30 = 1 day\n  - \u2192 2025-08-31 = 2 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-01 = 3 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-02 = 4 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-03 = 5 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-04 = 6 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-05 = 7 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-06 = 8 days\n- Therefore, 8 days elapsed between the announcement date (2025-08-29) and the calendar date of the booked review (2025-09-06).

Reasonable daytime range for \"afternoon\" is 12:00\u201318:00. For a conservative, simple computation I assume \"that afternoon\" corresponds to 15:00 (3:00 PM) local time on 2025-08-29.

The previous response included a clear and explicit scratchpad and computed derivation, which matches instructions. However, the \"additional_sentence_ids\" field in the results was left empty even though the question necessarily depends on the two selected sentences (N0-S0 and N0-S7). The instructions asked to list additional sentence IDs if applicable; at minimum the two selected sentences should be referenced there to show which sentences the QA depends on.\n2. There is a minor tension in the instructions about whether the question should include explicit assumed times. Some parts recommend avoiding absolute times in the question; other parts allow explicit assumptions if needed and require that assumptions be stated. The previous response chose to state assumptions explicitly (09:00 and 15:00) inside the question. This is acceptable because assumptions were made explicit and necessary to compute an absolute duration, but it slightly conflicts with the \"avoid absolute times in the question if possible\" guidance. The user requested minimal changes, so I will keep the explicit assumptions but note this choice.\n3. The previous response did not list the selected sentence IDs under \"additional_sentence_ids\" and did not explain the unique information each selected sentence provides. The task requires that any additional sentences be listed and explained. Even if no extra sentences beyond the originally selected ones were added, the output should show which sentences are required.\n\nCorrections made:\n- I will reproduce the QA but include the two selected sentence IDs (N0-S0 and N0-S7) in the \"additional_sentence_ids\" field, and provide a concise \"additional_sentence_explanation\" that states the unique role of each sentence (start point and end point). \n- I will keep the question wording and the answer identical to the previous response (minimal change), since the question explicitly states the assumptions and the derivation is valid and was shown in the scratchpad.\n\nNo other substantive changes are required.\n\n</scratchpad>",

I will assume the completion of the training session occurred at 00:00 (start of day) local time on 2025-08-29. This is explicitly stated below and used only because no time-of-day is provided in N1-S0.\n- The submission time in N4-S1 is taken as 09:12 local time on 2025-09-05 (absolute).\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Start (assumed): 2025-08-29 00:00 (local)\n- End (documented): 2025-09-05 09:12 (local)\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None selected. Both sentences N1-S0 and N4-S1 are required: N1-S0 provides the start date (training completion date) and N4-S1 provides the precise end timestamp.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the exact elapsed time between the completion of Maya Cortes's supervised full-contact training session (as reported in N1-S0) and the time-stamped submission of the daily-monitoring entry (N4-S1), making explicit the needed assumption about the unspecified time-of-day for the training completion. This ensures both sentences are necessary: N1-S0 yields the start date (but no time) and N4-S1 gives the precise end time; the assumption is needed to convert the start date into a precise datetime.\n\n- Unique information required from each sentence:\n  - N1-S0: the date on which the training was completed (2025-08-29). Needed to identify the start day.\n  - N4-S1: the exact submission time (09:12) and the event date (2025-09-05). Needed to identify the end datetime.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start datetime (assumption): 2025-08-29 00:00\n- End datetime (documented): 2025-09-05 09:12\n\nCompute difference:\n- Days: From 2025-08-29 to 2025-09-05 = 7 days\n- Time on final day: 09:12\n- Total elapsed = 7 days + 9 hours 12 minutes = 7 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes\n- Alternative representations: 177 hours 12 minutes; 10,632 minutes\n\n</scratchpad>",

This is inconsistent and should be corrected by explicitly explaining the unique information each sentence provides.\n\nOther notes:\n- The assumption that the training session finished at 00:00 on 2025-08-29 is arbitrary but was explicitly stated in the previous answer, which satisfies the requirement to make assumptions explicit. The task allows making assumptions when necessary; we will keep this assumption to minimize changes.\n- The computed duration (7 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes) is correct given the assumption.\n\nCorrections made:\n- Added the two required sentence IDs (N1-S0 and N4-S1) to <additional_sentence_ids>.\n- Replaced the placeholder \"None.\" in <additional_sentence_explanation> with explicit explanations of the unique information provided by N1-S0 and N4-S1 and why each is needed.\n\nNo other changes were necessary.

Thus we have a precise timestamp: 09:35 on 2025-09-05 (local time).\n- Event date: 2025-09-05.\n\nAssumptions:\n- N1-S0 provides only a date for the completion of the training session (2025-08-29) with no clock time. To compute a single precise duration we must assume a specific clock time for the training-session completion. I will assume the training session finished at 12:00 (noon) local time on 2025-08-29. This is an explicit, plausible assumption (a typical daytime training session); the assumption is stated in the question below.\n- No other sentences beyond the selected two are used to infer times.\n\nAbsolute dates (based on the assumption above):\n- Start (training completion): 2025-08-29 12:00 (assumed).\n- End (submission of non-availability notification): 2025-09-05 09:35 (from N4-S7; 09:35 on the event date 2025-09-05).\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the elapsed time between the completion of the supervised full-contact training session and the club's formal non-availability notification submission at 09:35. Require the assumption about the training completion clock time to make the interval computable; ensure the question states that assumption explicitly so it can be uniquely answered.\n- The unique information required from each selected sentence:\n  - N1-S0 provides the date on which the training session was completed (2025-08-29).\n  - N4-S7 provides the exact time of the notification submission (09:35) and the date of that event (2025-09-05).\n- Both sentences are necessary: without N1-S0 you don't know the earlier date; without N4-S7 you don't know the exact later timestamp.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Compute interval from 2025-08-29 12:00 to 2025-09-05 09:35.\n  - From 2025-08-29 12:00 to 2025-09-05 12:00 = 7 days exactly.\n  - Subtract 2 hours 25 minutes to go from 12:00 to 09:35 on 2025-09-05.\n  - 7 days \u2212 2 hours 25 minutes = 6 days, 21 hours, 35 minutes.\n\n</scratchpad>",
