The club physiotherapist recorded a mid-patellar girth difference of approximately 1.4 cm comparing the right knee to the left and noted a small suprapatellar fluid wave on bedside palpation at about 17:10 local time; the head of medical services informed the head coach and submitted the formal withdrawal through the league match-day change portal at 17:25, with arena match officials informed shortly thereafter.</text>\n</paragraph>\n<paragraph>\n<text>Following the assessment, the Harborfen Diagnostic Centre appointment was booked for 18:00 with an imaging request specifying a focused musculoskeletal ultrasound of the patellofemoral region including longitudinal and transverse views and Doppler assessment to evaluate for effusion or tendon pathology. On-site treatment included 400 mg of ibuprofen administered orally by the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist and application of a pneumatic cold-compression cuff set to approximately 6\u00b0C in 20-minute cycles, while pre- and post-treatment pain scores were recorded on a 0\u201310 scale.</text>\n</paragraph>\n<paragraph>\n<text>A re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran is scheduled for 08:00 the following morning and will include a repeat clinical examination, review of the ultrasound images, standardized knee range-of-motion measurements, and a documented minutes-management recommendation to be communicated to the Rivermark Lynx coaching staff after the assessment.
