  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying new named entities from a given outline of a fictional event description. Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<OUTLINE>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures. Note that these lists may be empty or contain partial information:\n\n<entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</entities>\n\nThe definitions with examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural landmarks, and regions.\nExamples: Paris, Mount Everest, California, Amazon Rainforest, Japan, Australia, Australian\n\n- Product\nDefinition: Goods or services created for consumer use or commercial purposes.\nExamples: iPhone, Coca-Cola, Microsoft Office, Tesla Model 3\n\n- Art\nDefinition: Creative works in various forms, including artifacts, ornaments, visual arts, literature, music, and performance.\nExamples: Mona Lisa, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Hamilton (musical)\n\n - Building\nDefinition: Structures designed for human occupancy or use, including residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity. However, this phrase contains the named entity Chicago (location)\n\nExample: \"I bought tickets to go on the Sky Needle, the highest skyscraper in town!\"\n- \"Sky Needle\" is a named entity (building)\n\nExample: \"Aboriginal people from a well known Australian city.\"\n- \"Aboriginal\" is a named entity (Organization)\n- \"Australia\" is a named entity (Location)\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

The club published the extension in an official press release on the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} website and social channels and completed the paperwork at the team's training facility with the head coach and general manager present. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} registered contract terms that reduce {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1}'s base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for the one-year extension. The recorded incentive structure includes per-appearance fees, stepped bonuses for reaching specific minutes thresholds in individual games and incremental payments tied to appearing in a target proportion of regular-season fixtures. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} completed a club medical assessment and monitored return-to-play program overseen by {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} after an injury layoff last season. The medical assessment consisted of strength and conditioning benchmarks, on-court movement and shooting tests and cardiovascular screening administered over a short monitoring period, with the club medical staff clearing {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} to progress into full-team contact training. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} filed the finalized roster that includes {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} with league administrators ahead of the domestic transfer deadline to secure the squad for the opening fixtures. The club submitted the roster to league administrators that afternoon and received confirmation of registration from the league, ensuring {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} is officially eligible for selection when the team begins competition. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} issued a short statement through {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} expressing commitment to earn playing time and to meet the incentives specified in the new contract.

Post-session assessments by the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical team recorded zero on a standard 0\u201310 pain scale, normal bilateral range-of-motion in the knee and ankle, and satisfactory single-leg hop performance during functional testing. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} head coach placed {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} on the available-for-selection list for the season opener after consulting with {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical staff. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} head coach noted that inclusion on the available-for-selection list is contingent on following a minutes-management plan that will initially limit {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} to a planned rotation of under 20 minutes while monitoring match response. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} submitted a match-day availability notice to league administrators naming {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} as eligible for selection for the season opener. {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} submitted the match-day availability notice through the league's official portal and received an automated confirmation receipt from league administrators confirming the submission. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} told assembled media, \"I'm ready to contribute under the minutes plan the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} sets,\" after the training session. {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} spoke to reporters outside the main court, smiling and accompanied by the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} physiotherapist, and added that {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} plans to focus on defensive intensity and on-court leadership while adhering to {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1}'s minutes plan.</outline></event>",
