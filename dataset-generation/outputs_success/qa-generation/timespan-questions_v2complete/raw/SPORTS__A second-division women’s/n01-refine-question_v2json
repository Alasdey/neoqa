    "SCRATCHPAD": "<scratchpad>\nN1-S0:\n- Time information: States that Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session on 2025-08-29. This provides an absolute calendar date for the completion of the session.\n- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the sentence itself gives this date).\n\nN1-S1:\n- Time information: States that \"The full-contact training session lasted approximately 75 minutes.\" This provides the duration of the session but does not give start or end clock times or a date.\n- Event date: Not explicitly given in this sentence; per instructions we use the event date (2025-08-29) when a sentence lacks an explicit date.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The session referenced in N1-S1 is the same session whose completion is dated in N1-S0 (both sentences are in the same event and clearly refer to the same supervised full-contact training session).\n- The session both started and finished on 2025-08-29 (no overnight crossing of midnight). This is reasonable given the context and is required to treat the duration as occurring within that date.\n\nAbsolute dates/times (derived):\n- Completion (end) of session: sometime on 2025-08-29 (exact clock time not specified).\n- Start of session: 75 minutes before the completion time on 2025-08-29 (exact clock time not specified).\n- Therefore the absolute time-span between session start and session end = 75 minutes.\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None added. Both selected sentences are necessary: N1-S0 provides the absolute calendar day (2025-08-29) anchoring the event; N1-S1 provides the numeric duration (75 minutes). Without N1-S0 one would lack the date anchor, and without N1-S1 one would lack the length.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the time span between the start and the end of the supervised full-contact training session that Maya Cortes completed on the day it was observed by Rivermark Lynx staff. The question must be answered by combining the date from N1-S0 (to anchor the session to that day) and the length from N1-S1. Frame the question so the reader must extract that the session was completed \"that day\" (N1-S0) and that the session lasted approximately 75 minutes (N1-S1).\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- From N1-S1: session duration = approximately 75 minutes.\n- N1-S0 anchors the session to 2025-08-29; under the assumption the session started and ended on that date, the time-span from session start to session end = 75 minutes.\n\n</scratchpad>",
