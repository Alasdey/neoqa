  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a complex question-answer pair based on a fictional event outline. Your goal is to create a question that asks about an absolute time span (duration) that can be computed using specific selected sentences from the outline.\n\nFirst, review the complete storyline outline:\n\n<complete_outline>\n{{STORYLINE_OUTLINE_TO_DATE}}\n</complete_outline>\n\nNow, focus on the selected sentences:\n\n<selected_sentences>\n{{SELECTED_SENTENCES}}\n</selected_sentences>\n\nTo create a time-span question based on the selected sentences, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the absolute date or time within each of the selected sentences if possible. If a sentence doesn't provide additional time information, use the event date as time information. Remember that the dates of individual sub-events within each event may differ from the event date. To compute the specific points in time, check if the selected sentences specify any of the following:\n   - Relative time information (e.g., \"six weeks ago\", \"in five days\", \"after two hours\") based on which you can compute a specific point in time\n   - Absolute time information (e.g., \"10:00 am\", \"March 22nd\")\n   - You can always assume that the date listed for each event is known. The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. \n   - If the specific points in time cannot be asserted with certainty but only estimated based on some likelihood, specify assumptions under which you can derive absolute points in time\n   - If the sentences describe durations, list the respective start and end dates/times together with the assumptions\n\n2. Think about the different options of absolute points of time and which time span between them would be most challenging to compute, ensuring that all selected sentences are required to compute the duration.\n\n3. Draft a specific question that asks for the time duration. This question can only be solved if one derives the absolute points in time from each of the selected sentences. The question must always ask about the duration between two points in time. Prefer time durations that differ from the absolute durations of the respective event (if multiple options of different possible ways to compute durations exist).\n\n4. Formulate a precise and correct answer to the question, which must be an absolute duration. Only use the information from the selected sentences and make the question very specific to avoid ambiguities. In the scratchpad, include a derivation of the answer using the absolute dates you estimated before.\n\n5. Ensure the validity of the questions:\n   - Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present.\n   - Make sure that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n   - Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to answer the question and that no other sentence from the <complete_outline> can replace any of the selected sentence in answering the question.\n   - Adjust the question accordingly to fulfill these criteria by making it more specific.\n\n6. Avoid absolute dates or times in your question if possible:\n   - If you needed to make an assumption about when something happened, try to explain it relative to other existing events or information from the <complete_outline>. Try to replace explicitly mentioned dates by anchoring them into some content of the <complete_outline> instead. If necessary, add the additional required sentence ID to your result and explain the unique information of this sentence that is necessary.\n   - Make sure that temporal reasoning is still required in the revised question. Double-check if the temporal information is still essential to answer the question after resolving the absolute dates. Think about different options (like start and end dates) to make sure that one must apply temporal reasoning to answer the question.\n\n7. If you must integrate additional information beyond what is specified within the selected sentences:\n   - Identify the unique information you must add to the question within the provided <complete_outline> and select the sentence communicating this unique information\n   - Explain what kind of unique information from this sentence is needed and why\n   - List the sentence ID of the newly selected sentence in your result\n   - Rewrite your question accordingly and ensure that all points listed in step 5 are valid when adding the newly selected sentence\n\nProvide your reasoning in the following format:\n<scratchpad>\n(Repeat for all sentence IDs)\n[Sentence ID]:\n- [Describe the time information from this sentence]\n- [Identify the event date]\nAssumptions:\n- [Make your assumptions explicit]\nAbsolute dates:\n- [List all relevant absolute dates from this sentence. Justify how they relate to the event date or other date information.]\n\n\nAdditional sentences:\n[Think about additional sentence IDs to add and explain your decision and what information from the sentence you require. List any new absolute dates based on this information.]\n\nQuestion Idea:\n[Outline how to create a challenging time-span question based on the absolute dates and selected information]\n- [For each selected sentence, specifically elaborate the unique information from this sentence that is required to answer the question. Think about how to frame the question without explicitly stating this unique information.]\n\n[Answer derivation]:\nCompute the answer using the absolute dates from above.\n\n<scratchpad>\n\nOutput your results in the following format:\n<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<qa>\n<question>[Your generated question about the time span]</question>\n<answer>[The precise and concise answer to the question]</answer>\n<additional_sentence_ids>[List of additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, if applicable]</additional_sentence_ids>\n<additional_sentence_explanation>[Explain the unique information of each additional sentence that is required to answer the question and justify why it is needed, if applicable]</additional_sentence_explanation>\n</qa>\n</results>\n\nRemember to make your question as specific as possible, ensuring that it can only be answered using the information from the selected sentences (and any additional sentences you may need to include). If you need to make assumptions, state them clearly in the question. Always provide a precise and concise answer to the question you generate.\n\nImportant reminders:\n- While each event provides a unique date, which can be helpful to identify the question, the provided date does not necessarily apply to all information listed in the event outline (or the selected sentences extracted from the event outline). The event date is always the latest possible date based on everything that has happened within the event. Think carefully about how the event date applies to the selected sentences before you start drafting your question. Some events may have happened in the past even though they are not described in the past tense. Use your common sense and the sequence of sentences within the event. If you are reasonably uncertain, make your assumption explicit and include it in your question.\n- Ensure that the question can ONLY be answered when ALL of the selected sentences are present, and that ALL of the selected sentences are needed to answer the question.\n- Make sure that no other information from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to infer the correct answer.\n- If you need to include additional sentences, clearly explain why they are necessary and what unique information they provide.\n- In your question clearly indicate if some point in time happens in the future as such (for example when including the planned end date of an ongoing or planned event).\n- In your question, DO NOT include the required temporal information. The temporal information must be inferred from the content of the selected sentences.\n- DO NOT create questions about time-spans that mix units that cannot be compared in a meaningful way (such as minutes and days, days and years).\n- If you make assumptions, make sure they are plausible.\n- If you rely on the event date, carefully assess if the whether the information likely occurred before or after the event date.\n- State your assumptions that are required to answer the question clearly in the question.\n- Make sure that the question cannot be answered without considering unique content from ALL selected evidence sentences (from <selected_sentences> and <additional_sentence_ids>)\n- Explicitly compute and list all dates, including start and end dates, based on your assumptions before you draft your question.\n- The answer should only consist of the correct time span and should not be a complete sentence.\n- Ensure that you DO NOT explicitly refer to absolute dates or relative time spans (from the selected sentences) in the question.

    "SELECTION_EXPLANATION": "Sentence N0-S7 anchors a specific point on the event date: \"the club submitted the roster ... that afternoon\" \u2014 interpreted as the afternoon of the article date, 2025-08-29. Sentence N0-S0 describes a \"one-year contract extension\" announced at that time, which implies the contract runs until one year after the signing/announcement: 2026-08-29. Therefore the duration between the roster submission/signing (afternoon of 2025-08-29) and the contract's nominal end date (2026-08-29) is one year (365 days).",
