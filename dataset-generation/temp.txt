<scratchpad>I'll go through each original outline sentence and add up to two specific, plausible supplementary sentences that a reporter could reasonably know at the time. I must not change original sentences. Keep details realistic and consistent: announcement method and timing; contract effective seasons; previous salary to show increase; leadership bonus conditions; context for director and coach quotes; Halloway's community/mentoring role; sponsorship value and activation; registration timing and process; promotion details for Jules Renby including age and contract type. Avoid introducing unrelated subevents or grand claims.</scratchpad>

I compared the outline to the provided entities and history. Both the <entities> and <history> sections were empty, so there are no pre-existing named-entity entries or prior events to conflict with the outline.

I then checked the outline internally for consistency:
- Contract length: a four-season extension "running through the end of the 2028-29 Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship season" taking effect from the start of 2025-26 covers the seasons 2025-26, 2026-27, 2027-28 and 2028-29 — this is internally consistent.
- Salary figures: increase from £72,000 to £95,000 is an uplift of £23,000 per year — the outline states "approximately £23,000 per year," which is correct.
- Leadership bonus: £20,000 per season, payable quarterly and conditional on remaining captain and being included in at least two-thirds of matchday squads — plausible and internally consistent.
- Timing: Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office confirmed registration on 15 July 2025 — this matches the given next-event date (2025-07-15).
- The club's announcement channels (12:00 BST press release on the club website and a short media briefing at the training ground) and quotes from named persons are coherent.
- Promotion of academy player Jules Renby to a one-year development contract and eligibility for matchday 23 is consistent with the roster change described.

Because there are no prior entities/events to contradict, and the outline is internally consistent, no changes are necessary.

Known follow-up events from the history: Harwick Vale announced Cormac Halloway's four-season extension effective from the 2025-26 season (contract registered 2025-07-15), the deal raises his salary to £95,000 with a £20,000-per-season leadership bonus payable quarterly conditional on captaincy and matchday inclusion, Harwick Vale arranged a one-year front-of-shirt sponsorship with Northbridge Brewing (~£65,000) to balance the 2025 operating budget, and academy prospect Jules Renby was promoted to the senior squad on a one-year development contract; my continuations remain tied to these items and are dated shortly after 2025-07-15 or directly concern the 15 July announcement so they are consistent with the recorded timeline.
</thought_process>

<summary>
<text>Harwick Vale announced a summer schedule of community coaching sessions led by captain Cormac Halloway, confirming he will run weekly youth clinics through August as part of his commitment to local development.</text>
<date>2025-07-20</date>
</summary>

<thought_process>
Known follow-ups to consider: Cormac's new contract and leadership-bonus conditions, the club's reliance on the Northbridge sponsorship for the 2025 budget, and Jules Renby's promotion to the senior squad; this continuation reports a supporter-group reaction within days of the 15 July announcement and is dated shortly after to reflect immediate local response.
</thought_process>

<summary>
<text>A local supporters' trust publicly requested a detailed breakdown of Harwick Vale's 2025 operating budget and the terms of the Cormac Halloway extension, saying the club should clarify how the leadership bonus and new sponsorship funds are being allocated.</text>
<date>2025-07-22</date>
</summary>

<thought_process>
Relevant prior facts: Cormac remains club captain under a contract that requires matchday inclusion for bonus entitlement and the squad has just been amended to include promoted academy player Jules Renby; this continuation is a preseason development (before or during summer friendlies) and dated in August to reflect typical timing of friendly matches and selection decisions ahead of the 2025-26 season start.
</thought_process>

<summary>
<text>Head coach Eden Trask named 19-year-old Jules Renby on the bench for Harwick Vale's first preseason friendly and hailed his physicality after Renby made a late substitute appearance in the match.</text>
<date>2025-08-24</date>
</summary>

<thought_process>
Baseline items to respect: the July 15 contract registration, the club's one-year sponsorship with Northbridge Brewing intended to help cover 2025 costs, and the leadership-bonus conditions tied to Cormac's captaincy and matchday inclusion; this continuation presents a plausible preseason setback for Cormac that could temporarily affect those conditions and is dated in August before the season begins.
</thought_process>

<summary>
<text>Harwick Vale confirmed that captain Cormac Halloway sustained a minor shoulder strain in training and will be sidelined for approximately two to three weeks, with the club saying they will monitor his recovery ahead of the 2025-26 season opener.</text>

Known follow-up events from the provided history: on 15 July 2025 Harwick Vale Rugby Club announced and registered Cormac Halloway’s four-season extension, disclosed the increased salary and a £20,000-per-season leadership bonus, confirmed a one‑year front‑of‑shirt sponsorship with Northbridge Brewing (~£65,000) to help balance the 2025 operating budget, and promoted academy player Jules Renby to the senior squad. No other events are recorded between 15 July and the given continuation date of 22 July 2025.

All three generated continuations are dated 2025-07-22, keep the central topic (Harwick Vale’s finances/contract terms), maintain a critical/negative stance and a medium local impact (supporters’ scrutiny, possible formal or member-level action), and are realistic next steps after the 15 July disclosures. I made each summary a single objective sentence and ensured the three are mutually exclusive by assigning each a distinct escalation path (formal compliance complaint threat, commissioning an independent review instead of a complaint, and escalation following a club refusal that triggers a members’ meeting) so that if one path occurs the others would not occur in the same way.

<scratchpad>I will create 10 concise, chronological story items for 2025-07-22 about a supporters' trust requesting financial details and threatening a complaint to the Elmstone Regional Rugby Council. I will introduce a new local trust name ("Harwick Community Supporters' Trust") and include existing entities Harwick Vale Rugby Club, Cormac Halloway, Northbridge Brewing, Marina Kestrel, Eden Trask, Jules Renby, and Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship/Elmstone Regional Rugby Council where appropriate. Each storyitem will be atomic and reference full names when used.</scratchpad>

<scratchpad>We need to add supplementary specific sentences after each original sentence. Keep additions realistic, local-sports reporting detail. Avoid contradicting known contract facts. No new subevents. Avoid repeating known history specifics (like salary numbers) but can reference concerns about salary increases. Use plausible local media names and practical details like timestamps, signatures, deadlines (calculate 14 days -> 2025-08-05). Keep each added sentence self-contained and descriptive.</scratchpad>

I compared the 2025-07-22 outline items to the previously established history and entity list.

Key checks and findings:
- Harwick Vale Rugby Club, Cormac Halloway, Marina Kestrel, Eden Trask, Jules Renby, Northbridge Brewing and Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship / Elmstone Regional Rugby Council all appear in the prior history and the entity list. Their roles and the timeline (contract registered 2025-07-15) are consistent.
- The new actor Harwick Community Supporters' Trust and local media outlets (Harwick Gazette, the Teal Chronicle, Vale FM) are not previously listed but introducing a supporters' trust and local media is plausible and does not contradict existing facts. The outline's content about the Trust raises requests that directly relate to the 15 July contract announcement — this is consistent.
- Dates and times: The Trust letter dated 2025-07-22 is one week after the 15 July announcement — plausible. The club's acknowledgment posted at 11:45 BST and Cormac Halloway's statement issued at 14:05 BST are time details that do not conflict with prior timestamps.
- Use of Elmstone Regional Rugby Council compliance procedures in the outline is consistent: the Council is the organizer in the entity list and may handle complaints; previously the Championship's compliance office registered the contract. Having both bodies referenced (registration by the Championship compliance office on 15 July; the Council advising media on complaint procedures on 22 July) is not contradictory.
- Requested financial details and the Trust's 14-day deadline (deadline 2025-08-05) are reasonable follow-ups to the 15 July announcement.
- Club actions described (consult legal/financial advisers, propose redacted summary, propose meeting dates) are consistent with Marina Kestrel's role and prior statements about retaining leadership and mentoring, and with Harwick Vale Rugby Club's earlier budgetary adjustment via a one-year sponsorship with Northbridge Brewing.

No factual contradictions were found between the outline and the established history/entities. No changes to the storyitems were necessary.

Conclusion: The outline is consistent with the provided history and entities. I will output the storyitems unchanged.

Known follow-up events and deadlines from the provided history: the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust published a public letter on 2025-07-22 that set a 14-day deadline of 2025-08-05 for disclosure or it would file a formal compliance complaint with Elmstone Regional Rugby Council; Harwick Vale Rugby Club instructed its finance team on 2025-07-22 to prepare a redacted 2025 operating-budget summary and to propose meeting dates with the Trust within ten working days (i.e. a response and meetings are expected on or before the Trust's 2025-08-05 deadline); Cormac Halloway publicly said on 2025-07-22 he would cooperate and was available to meet Trust representatives once permitted information is clarified; Elmstone's compliance office has not yet received a formal complaint as of 2025-07-22 and supplied submission guidance. All four proposed summaries below are therefore scheduled to occur on or before 2025-08-05 and directly relate to these known follow-ups (redacted budget publication, meeting proposals, possible complaint filing, and sponsorship disclosure). Each continuation focuses on one or more named entities from the history and reflects realistic, local sports governance and community-relations developments (ranging from cooperative engagement to escalation to a formal complaint), while keeping tone factual and plausible.

Known follow-up events and deadlines from the provided history: the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust published a public letter on 2025-07-22 that set a 14-day deadline of 2025-08-05 for disclosure or it would file a formal compliance complaint with the Elmstone Regional Rugby Council; Harwick Vale Rugby Club instructed its finance team on 2025-07-22 to prepare a redacted 2025 operating-budget summary and to propose meeting dates with the Trust within ten working days (i.e. responses and meetings are expected on or before 2025-08-05); Cormac Halloway said on 2025-07-22 he would cooperate and was available to meet Trust representatives once permitted information is clarified; Elmstone's compliance office had not received a formal complaint as of 2025-07-22 and provided submission guidance. All four summaries below are scheduled to occur on or before 2025-08-05 and directly relate to these known follow-ups, remaining consistent with the timeline and focusing on the named entities from the history.

Known follow-up events to consider: the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust published a disclosure request on 2025-07-22 with a 14-day deadline to 2025-08-05; Harwick Vale Rugby Club acknowledged the request, said it would consult advisers and prepare a redacted budget summary and meeting proposals; Cormac Halloway issued a statement on 2025-07-22 saying he would cooperate and was available to meet Trust representatives; the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship had already registered Halloway's contract on 2025-07-15. A meeting on 2025-07-31 fits the timeline and is consistent with these known events. I created three plausible, locally focused, neutral-to-positive continuations for 2025-07-31 that are mutually exclusive by varying what Halloway did or provided during the single meeting (immediate provision of redacted contract details; declining to discuss contractual matters and focusing on coaching; agreeing to join an independent liaison panel), while keeping the central subject (Cormac Halloway), stance (neutral/constructive), impact (low–medium local/community) and the date the same.

<scratchpad>I'll go through each original sentence and add up to two specific supplemental sentences that a reporter could plausibly know on 2025-07-31. Avoid repeating known contractual/budget figures or details already in the history. Keep details local and realistic: meeting time, attendee numbers, room description, moderator role and ground rules, specific times for coaching sessions, eligibility caps, how the summary will be circulated, steps for compliance guidance, and procedural follow-ups. Ensure each added sentence is self-contained and uses full names rather than pronouns.</scratchpad>

<scratchpad>
I compared the July 31 outline with the established history and entity list.

Checks performed and findings:
- Dates/timeline: The meeting on 2025-07-31 follows the 2025-07-22 Trust letter and Harwick Vale Rugby Club's response — timeline is plausible. The planned coaching sessions starting week commencing 2025-08-04 and the publication deadline of 2025-08-02 fit the timeline and do not conflict with prior events.
- Roles and actions: Cormac Halloway's willingness to engage with supporters and his refusal to discuss contractual/budgetary details at the session match his earlier statement on 2025-07-22 that contractual details should be handled by the club and competition offices. Harwick Vale Rugby Club preparing redacted budget summaries (from 2025-07-22) is consistent with an informal meeting and follow-up actions described in the outline.
- Jules Renby: Questions about integrating Jules Renby into the first team are consistent with his promotion to the senior squad on 2025-07-15.
- Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship: The plan to seek written guidance from Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office aligns with previous references to the competition's compliance role.
- Meeting logistics: The meeting time (11:00–11:45 BST) and choice of a small conference room, observers (communications officer and academy manager), and moderation are all plausible and do not contradict prior facts (e.g., first-team training at noon).
- New named individuals: Rowan Ferley, Priya Sander, and Dr. Isla Marden do not appear in the provided entity list. Their presence is reasonable as local Trust representatives and an independent moderator. The instructions permit reasonable additions. No inconsistency arises from adding these minor, previously-unlisted persons.

Conclusion:
- No substantive inconsistencies or contradictions found between the outline and the provided history/entities.
- No alterations were necessary to preserve consistency or plausibility.

I will output the storyitems unchanged (retaining full names where present).

IDENTIFIED_NAMED_ENTITIES_IN_OUTLINE:
- Persons: Cormac Halloway (already in entities), Rowan Ferley, Priya Sander, Dr. Isla Marden, Jules Renby (already), academy manager (role, not named), communications officer (role)
- Organizations/events/others: Harwick Vale Rugby Club (already), Harwick Community Supporters' Trust (already), Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship (already), "Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office" (explicit full phrase in outline) — treated as an organizational unit, Harwick Vale Rugby Club website (not a distinct named entity), training ground / smaller conference room (not uniquely named building)

CHECK AGAINST EXISTING <entities>:
- Rowan Ferley: NOT present → NEW (Person)
- Priya Sander: NOT present → NEW (Person)
- Dr. Isla Marden: NOT present → NEW (Person)
- Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office: Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship exists as an event, but the specific "compliance office" string is not present → NEW (Organization)
- No other uniquely named entities in the outline that are not already in <entities>.

DECISIONS / NOTES:
- Did not add "Harwick Vale Rugby Club's training ground" or "smaller conference room" because these are not uniquely named building entities.
- Did not add internal roles (academy manager, communications officer, finance team) as named persons/organizations because not named.
- The compliance office is included because the outline explicitly names "Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office"; classify as organization per guidelines.

FINAL NEW ENTITIES TO OUTPUT (distinct, as appearing in outline):
- <person>Rowan Ferley</person>
- <person>Priya Sander</person>
- <person>Dr. Isla Marden</person>
- <organization>Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office</organization>

REVIEW ISSUES RAISED:
- USER POINTED OUT: "Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office" exceeds 5 words.
- REQUIREMENT: Named entities should be unique, clearly defined, and not exceed 5 words.

RE-EVALUATION:
- Persons identified in the outline:
  - Cormac Halloway — already in <entities> (PERSON-1) → exclude.
  - Jules Renby — already in <entities> (PERSON-4) → exclude.
  - Rowan Ferley — NOT in <entities> → keep (Person).
  - Priya Sander — NOT in <entities> → keep (Person).
  - Dr. Isla Marden — NOT in <entities> → keep (Person).

- Organization-like phrase:
  - "Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office" — explicitly named in the outline, but:
    - It is a sub-unit of the already-listed Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship (EVENT-1).
    - It exceeds the 5-word limit.
    - To satisfy the user's constraints, and because the parent entity Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship already exists in <entities>, I will NOT add the longer compliance-office phrase as a separate new entity. Treating it as part of the existing competition avoids creating a >5-word new entry and avoids duplicating the parent entity.

FINAL DECISION:
- Add only the three new persons that are explicitly named in the outline and not present in the existing <entities> data:
  - Rowan Ferley
  - Priya Sander
  - Dr. Isla Marden

NO OTHER NEW NAMED ENTITIES WILL BE ADDED (the compliance office is omitted for the reasons above).

Known follow-up events from the history: the moderated Q&A on 2025-07-31 included an agreement that the Harwick Community Supporters' Trust would circulate a short meeting summary within 48 hours (i.e. by 2025-08-02) and that the Trust and Harwick Vale Rugby Club would prepare a shortlist of precise data items and jointly email the Elmstone Regional Rugby Championship compliance office within seven calendar days to request written guidance. All three alternative continuations use the same date (2025-08-02), maintain the central topic (the Trust's circulation of the Q&A summary), keep a neutral/low-impact stance, and remain plausible given those prior commitments (e.g., summaries may reflect preparatory steps toward the joint submission or minor procedural variations such as polling members or delaying email pending redactions). Each summary is written as a single objective sentence and is mutually exclusive: one version has the Trust include a proposed shortlist for endorsement, another has the Trust delay emailing members and only post online, and the third has the Trust email a summary with a member poll to prioritise follow-ups ahead of the planned joint submission.

I verified that all three alternative continuations occur on 2025-08-02, keep the central topic (the Trust's handling of the 2025-07-31 Q&amp;A summary), preserve a neutral/low-impact stance, and remain plausible given the prior commitments (e.g., emailing members, posting online, seeking member input or pausing for redaction are all realistic next steps). Each summary is a single objective sentence and the three are mutually exclusive (if the Trust defers emailing members, it cannot simultaneously have emailed them that day; if it emailed with an attached shortlist, it cannot also have deferred emailing; the version with a poll is distinct from the version that simply attached the shortlist).

I compared the August 2, 2025 outline with the prior history and the named entities.

- Prior history (31 Jul meeting) recorded that Harwick Community Supporters' Trust would circulate a brief summary to ~1,200 subscribed members within 48 hours and prepare a shortlist of data items for the Elmstone compliance office — the outline's timing (email and website notice at 09:00–09:05 BST on 2 Aug) and the presence of a three-item shortlist are consistent with that commitment.
- The three shortlisted items align with earlier Trust requests (budget breakdown, leadership-bonus terms/criteria, sponsorship disclosure). The outline specifies a redacted/summary approach and excludes sensitive clauses, which matches the earlier emphasis on balancing transparency and confidentiality.
- Rowan Ferley and Priya Sander are named in the history as participants; their roles in submitting a comment and posting a clarification are consistent with their prior involvement.
- Harwick Vale Rugby Club's finance team had already been instructed (by Marina Kestrel on 22 Jul) to prepare a redacted budget summary — the club acknowledgement and Marina's subsequent instruction on 2 Aug are consistent (a follow-up/operational step).
- Dates, times and member counts (132 endorsements out of ~1,200 contacted) are plausible and do not conflict with earlier records.
- No entity names conflict with the provided entity list. The email addresses and PDF filenames are new but are reasonable operational details and do not contradict prior information.
- Overall: no inconsistencies or contradictions found that require changes. Therefore the outline is consistent and is output unchanged.

For major tournament results and championship outcomes in sports, plausible scenarios include international or continental championships in team sports such as football, basketball, or volleyball, where an underdog team wins its first title or a dominant team extends a winning streak. Another common pattern is an individual sport like tennis, athletics, or swimming, where records are broken in finals, or a long-time contender finally secures a championship. Without specific keywords, generic but realistic settings can involve neutral host nations, indoor arenas, or aquatic centers, with references to seedings, aggregate scores, overtime, or penalty shootouts. To avoid real or fictional named entities, descriptions focus on roles and attributes such as “the host nation,” “the defending champion,” “the top seed,” “the regional club,” or “the capital’s team,” along with concrete statistics like final scores, rankings, and records. Varying newsworthiness can be achieved by contrasting a globally followed event, such as a continental football final, with a more localized event, like a regional youth championship in swimming or athletics, where age-group records and development pathways are highlighted rather than worldwide impact.

<summary>An unseeded national football side defeated the defending titleholder 2–1 in the final of a continental championship, securing its first major senior trophy after overturning an early deficit in regulation time.</summary>

<summary>A regional youth swimming championship concluded at an indoor aquatic center with a 16-year-old competitor lowering the meet record in the 200-meter freestyle by 0.4 seconds, contributing to the overall team title for a mixed-age development squad.</summary>

Player transfers and contract signings in sports can include record-breaking transfer fees, long-term extensions, rookie contracts, and short-term deals; trades may involve multiple players, draft rights, and future considerations; different sports contexts include top-division football, second-tier basketball, minor-league baseball, and regional hockey or cricket competitions; contract structures may mention performance bonuses, appearance clauses, buy-out options, and salary-cap management; timing often links to transfer windows, off-season periods, or trade deadlines; international moves may require work permits and adaptation to new competitive levels, while lower-profile signings can be about depth, injury cover, or retaining local talent.
</associations>

<summary>A leading club in a national top-tier football league has finalized a five-year contract with a 19-year-old striker from a neighboring country's premier division, agreeing a record transfer fee for the league that includes performance-related bonuses and a future sell-on percentage.</summary>

<summary>A second-division women’s basketball team has filled its final roster spot before the domestic transfer deadline by signing its veteran point guard to a one-year extension with a reduced salary and incentives tied to games played following last season’s injury layoff.</summary>

<scratchpad>I will create a realistic sports event outline with minimal named entities to satisfy the requirement that every storyitem references all named entities by full name. I will use two invented names: the team "Rivermark Lynx" and the player "Maya Cortes". Date will be generated as 2025-08-29, which is plausible for a pre-season domestic transfer deadline. I must produce exactly five atomic storyitems in chronological order: announcement, contract details, medical/recovery context, roster registration/administrative consequence, and player statement. Each storyitem will mention both "Rivermark Lynx" and "Maya Cortes" and present only a single fact per item.</scratchpad>

<scratchpad>I'll add one supplementary sentence after each original outline sentence. I must keep original sentences unchanged and ensure added details are plausible for a reporter to know at this time. I will avoid inventing new named persons and will only use existing names Rivermark Lynx and Maya Cortes. Supplementary details will cover announcement medium and presence of club officials, structure of incentives, specifics of the medical assessment and clearance progression, confirmation of roster filing by the league, and a short direct quote attributed to Maya that aligns with her stated commitment.</scratchpad>

I compared the outline with the provided entities and history. Both the entities list and the history of events are empty, so there are no prior recorded events or named-entity entries to contradict the outline.

Because there are no existing references to conflict with (no prior mentions of Rivermark Lynx, Maya Cortes, league administrators, etc.), and the outline is internally consistent and plausible (contract extension, medical clearance, roster filing and league confirmation, public statement), no changes are necessary.

I will therefore return the outline unchanged, ensuring all original story items are included and keeping full names as in the outline.

IDENTIFIED_ENTITIES: From the OUTLINE I found the following explicit named mentions: "Rivermark Lynx" and "Maya Cortes".

CHECK_OTHER_POTENTIAL_ENTITIES: Phrases such as "domestic transfer deadline", "team's training facility", "league administrators", "Rivermark Lynx website" and "opening fixtures" are generic/descriptive and not presented as distinct proper names; therefore they are not listed as separate named entities. No buildings, products, events, locations or miscellaneous named items are explicitly named beyond the two above.

CHECK_AGAINST_EXISTING_LIST: The provided <entities> list is empty, so both identified entities are new.

FINAL_VERIFICATION: Both names appear exactly as in the OUTLINE and refer to distinct entity types: "Maya Cortes" (person) and "Rivermark Lynx" (organization). No redundancies or alternate forms to merge.

Known events from history: 2025-08-29 — Rivermark Lynx announced a one-year contract extension for Maya Cortes, completed medical assessment and monitored return-to-play program, cleared her to progress into full-team contact training, and filed the finalized roster with league administrators (registration confirmed). Any continuations must either concern that 2025-08-29 event or be dated before it; they cannot be dated after 2025-08-29. For the first summary I therefore propose a same-day (2025-08-29) follow-up describing Maya's first full-contact training availability and squad listing, which is consistent with the clearance and roster registration recorded on that date.
</thought_process>

<summaries>
<summary>
<text>Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session without setbacks and was listed by Rivermark Lynx as available for selection for the season opener.</text>

<thought_process>
Known events recap: 2025-08-29 clearance and roster registration are the confirmed outcomes in the history; any earlier developments that led into that clearance are consistent provided they occur before 2025-08-29. For the second summary I propose a plausible pre-clearance (2025-08-27) medical follow-up that shows a minor precautionary delay (additional imaging and monitoring) which still allows the club to clear and register her on 2025-08-29.
</thought_process>

<summary>
<text>On 2025-08-27 Rivermark Lynx medical staff ordered additional imaging after Maya Cortes reported minor discomfort during movement testing, extending her monitored return-to-play program but not ultimately preventing her registration.</text>

Known follow-up events from the provided history: Rivermark Lynx signed Maya Cortes to a one-year extension on 2025-08-29 with incentives and a reduced base salary; the club completed medical assessments and cleared her to progress into full-team contact training; the finalized roster including Cortes was filed with the league and registration confirmed; and Cortes issued a statement committing to earn minutes. The provided continuation (also dated 2025-08-29) says she completed a supervised full-contact training session without setbacks and was listed as available for selection for the season opener. 

All three alternative summaries remain consistent with these known facts and the 2025-08-29 date: each assumes she completed the supervised contact session and is eligible, then diverges into mutually exclusive selection outcomes that are plausible within professional sports roster management. I preserved the central topic (Maya Cortes), the positive stance (return-to-play progress and team availability), and the medium-impact scope (matchday selection details), and ensured each summary cannot simultaneously occur with the others (starting player vs bench role vs being included under a formal minutes-management plan that precludes starting).

I compared the new outline (event date 2025-08-29) with the existing history and entity list.

Relevant points from the history:
- On 2025-08-29 Rivermark Lynx announced a one-year contract extension for Maya Cortes, completed medical assessment and monitored return-to-play program, and the medical staff cleared her to progress into full-team contact training.
- Rivermark Lynx filed the finalized roster with league administrators ahead of the domestic transfer deadline and received confirmation of registration.
- Contract incentives included per-appearance fees and bonuses tied to minutes and appearance thresholds.
- Maya Cortes issued a statement committing to earn playing time.

Comparison to the outline:
- The outline reports that Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session on 2025-08-29 observed by Rivermark Lynx medical and coaching staff. This follows logically from the earlier clearance to progress into full-team contact training and is plausible on the same date.
- Details of the session (75 minutes at the Rivermark Lynx training facility in Harborfen, controlled live scrimmage, post-session assessments reporting zero pain, normal ROM, satisfactory single-leg hop) are consistent with the prior medical monitoring and describe typical functional testing. No contradictions found.
- The head coach placing Maya Cortes on the available-for-selection list after medical consultation is consistent with the prior roster registration and the club's confirmation of eligibility. The outline also describes Rivermark Lynx submitting a match-day availability notice and receiving an automated confirmation — this aligns with the earlier roster registration confirmation.
- The minutes-management plan (initially limiting to under 20 minutes) is consistent with the existing contract incentive structure tied to minutes and is a plausible, non-contradictory implementation of cautious reintroduction. Maya Cortes' media quotes about adhering to the minutes plan accord with her earlier statement about earning minutes.

No inconsistencies or contradictions were found between the outline, the history, and the named entities. All named entities in the outline match the provided entity names (Maya Cortes; Rivermark Lynx). Therefore no changes are necessary.

I will output the story items unchanged, ensuring full names are used consistently.

IDENTIFIED_ENTITIES: Maya Cortes (Person), Rivermark Lynx (Organization), Harborfen (Location), Rivermark Lynx training facility (Building/Place phrase), season opener (Event — generic), league administrators (Organization role — generic), league's official portal (Product/Service — generic), Rivermark Lynx medical and coaching staff / physiotherapist / head coach (Person-role, not named individuals), match-day availability notice / minutes-management plan (Miscellaneous/generic documents).

CHECK_EXISTING_ENTITIES: The provided <entities> contains:
- <person> Maya Cortes — already present.
- <organization> Rivermark Lynx — already present.
- Harborfen appears as the <headquarters> value inside the Rivermark Lynx organization element — thus Harborfen is present in the XML data.

DECISIONS:
- Exclude Maya Cortes and Rivermark Lynx because they are already listed.
- Exclude Harborfen because it appears in the existing <entities> (headquarters field).
- Do NOT create entities for generic or unnamed references: "season opener" (not a named event), "league administrators" (no league name), "league's official portal" (generic service, no proper name), "Rivermark Lynx training facility" (descriptive/location tied to existing organization but not a distinct named building in the entities list), and role/descriptive references (head coach, physiotherapist, medical staff).
- No other proper-named entities appear.

CONCLUSION: No new named entities that are explicitly named in the OUTLINE and not already present in the provided <entities>.

Known follow-up items from the provided history: on 2025-08-29 Rivermark Lynx announced Maya Cortes' one-year contract extension, completed her medical clearance and a supervised full-contact training session, placed her on the available-for-selection list under a minutes-management plan (initially under 20 minutes), and submitted a match-day availability notice to league administrators that same day. Any plausible next steps must therefore relate to that 2025-08-29 sequence (either concerning those submissions/medical checks or occurring earlier that day) and be consistent with the club's cautious minutes-management approach and league registration procedures. With that in mind I generated two realistic, same-day continuations: one positive (final match-day roster confirmation and planned limited minutes) and one negative (a late pre-game medical concern leading to withdrawal and renewed rehab), each referencing the named entities (Maya Cortes and Rivermark Lynx) and remaining dated on 2025-08-29 to comply with the requirement that events either concern the 2025-08-29 actions or occur before them.

Known follow-up events from the provided history: Maya Cortes was medically cleared to progress into full-team contact training on 2025-08-29, placed on the available-for-selection list under a minutes-management plan, and Rivermark Lynx submitted a match-day availability notice naming her as eligible for the season opener on the same date; she also spoke to media expressing readiness to contribute. The provided continuation (pre-game assessment finds mild knee swelling and she is withdrawn and returned to rehab on 2025-08-29) must be consistent with those prior entries and the sports-genre context (a low-impact, precautionary development the day of the match). All three alternative continuations below preserve the central topic (Maya Cortes and Rivermark Lynx), the negative stance (precautionary withdrawal/limited availability), the low impact (short-term, day-of measures rather than long-term absence), and the same date (2025-08-29), while presenting mutually exclusive immediate actions the club could plausibly take.

I compared the new outline items for 2025-08-29 with the existing history and entity records.

Entities:
- The outline uses "Rivermark Lynx" and "Maya Cortes", which match the provided entity names exactly. Harborfen Diagnostic Centre and Dr. Elias Verran are new but their introduction is allowed per instructions.

History consistency:
- The history shows Maya Cortes was cleared to progress into full-team contact training and was placed on the available-for-selection list with the club submitting match-day availability earlier on 2025-08-29. The new outline describes a later pre-match assessment on the same date that found mild right-knee swelling and resulted in withdrawal from the match-day roster. This is logically consistent: being on the available list earlier does not preclude a later pre-match withdrawal after new findings.
- Treatments and diagnostics (single oral anti-inflammatory, ibuprofen 400 mg, ice-compression, urgent ultrasound at a local diagnostic centre, same-day imaging appointment, and overnight re-evaluation next morning) are plausible and do not contradict prior events (which reported no pain earlier that day).
- Times in the outline (assessment findings ~17:10, formal withdrawal submitted at 17:25, ultrasound booked for 18:00, re-evaluation next morning at 08:00) are internally consistent and plausible relative to the earlier events on the same date.

No substantive inconsistencies or contradictions were found. New named medical providers/facilities are reasonable additions. Therefore no changes to the story items are required.

IDENTIFIED_ENTITIES: Dr. Elias Verran; Harborfen Diagnostic Centre; ibuprofen

REVIEW OF OUTLINE:
- Persons named: Maya Cortes (already present in entities), Dr. Elias Verran (new).
- Organizations/buildings named: Rivermark Lynx (already present), Harborfen Diagnostic Centre (not in existing entities — new). Harborfen as a location appears in existing organization headquarters but "Harborfen Diagnostic Centre" is a distinct named organization.
- Products/other named terms: "ibuprofen" is explicitly named (generic drug) — treat as a product (new).
- Anatomical/clinical terms (patellofemoral region, Doppler assessment, suprapatellar) are generic clinical terms; they are named but better classified as miscellaneous if included. Decision: only include ibuprofen as a clear product-level named entity. "patellofemoral region" is descriptive anatomical term — not included to avoid overreach.
- Confirmed that Maya Cortes and Rivermark Lynx are already present in <entities> and therefore must be excluded from the "new" list.

CHECK AGAINST EXISTING <entities>:
- Maya Cortes -> present; omit.
- Rivermark Lynx -> present; omit.
- Harborfen Diagnostic Centre -> NOT present; include as organization.
- Dr. Elias Verran -> NOT present; include as person.
- ibuprofen -> NOT present; include as product.

FINAL NEW ENTITIES (distinct, exact names as in outline):
- Person: Dr. Elias Verran
- Organization: Harborfen Diagnostic Centre
- Product: ibuprofen

The history records two specific follow-up appointments: a focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre booked for 18:00 on 2025-08-29, and an overnight re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran scheduled for 08:00 on 2025-08-30 to review images, repeat the exam, and document minutes-management recommendations for Maya Cortes; my continuations are therefore limited to events that either occur before or concern that 08:00 re-evaluation. I generated one plausible immediate-evening outcome from the 18:00 ultrasound (dated 2025-08-29) and one plausible documented clinical decision arising from the 08:00 re-evaluation (dated 2025-08-30); both summaries focus on named entities from the history, are realistic conservative sports-medicine developments, and maintain an objective tone consistent with the prior records.

===========================================================================

<scratchpad>Goal: For each original outline sentence, add one supplementary specific sentence (up to one) directly after it, as separate <storyitem>. Keep original sentences unchanged. Ensure new details are plausible, known to a reporter at this time, and do not repeat history or known_entities specifics. Avoid contradictions.

Considerations per sentence:
1) Ultrasound review — add specific imaging findings (effusion size, absence of tendon tear, Doppler no hyperemia). History noted ultrasound performed but not results, so permissible.
2) Clinical exam — add ROM degrees, pain VAS scores at rest and provocation, ligament tests stable.
3) Clearance/minutes cap — add operational specifics: applies per match, split into stints, applies first two fixtures, avoid high-intensity minutes. Keep within scope of decision-making.
4) Daily symptom checks — specify which measures to record, who logs them, timeframe for reporting (physio logs into club medical portal within 2 hours). History already mentioned daily checks in general, but not specifics.
5) One-week review — specify date/time (2025-09-06 09:00), tests to be performed (repeat ultrasound, isokinetic strength testing, monitored on-court conditioning), keeping to reassessment only.

Ensure none of the added sentences introduce new ongoing events beyond the scope. Maintain chronological order: each original sentence followed by its additional sentence. Single-sentence per storyitem. No pronouns when referring back; use full names where needed. All consistent with sports genre and prior data.

I compared the new outline (2025-08-30) against the prior history and the named entities.

- Entities: The outline uses Dr. Elias Verran, Maya Cortes, Rivermark Lynx, and Harborfen Diagnostic Centre — these match the provided entity names exactly.
- Timing and planned actions: The history recorded a same-day ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre on 2025-08-29, administration of 400 mg ibuprofen, withdrawal from the match roster, and a scheduled 08:00 re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran on the following morning. The outline has Dr. Elias Verran reviewing the images at 08:00 and performing a repeat clinical exam — this aligns with the scheduled re-evaluation.
- Clinical findings: The history mentioned a small suprapatellar fluid wave/swelling on bedside assessment. The outline documents a small anechoic suprapatellar effusion (~7–9 mm) on ultrasound, minimal pain scores (1–2/10), intact tendon continuity, and stable ligament tests. These findings are consistent and do not contradict the earlier recorded mild swelling and functional testing.
- Minutes-management: The history had an initial minutes-management plan limiting Maya Cortes to under 20 minutes. The outline tightens this to 10–12 minutes for immediate fixtures — this is a stricter but plausible refinement of the minutes plan by the treating physician and is not contradictory.
- Monitoring and follow-up: The history said an overnight re-evaluation would include a documented minutes-management recommendation and that the club would be notified. The outline includes daily symptom checks, specific data to be recorded by the physiotherapist, upload requirements, and a one-week functional review at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre on 2025-09-06 — all consistent with and expanding the planned follow-up in the history.

No factual inconsistencies or contradictions were found that require correction. All storyitems are consistent with the established events and entities.

<thought_process>Known follow-up events from the provided history: a one-week functional review for Maya Cortes is scheduled at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre for 09:00 on 2025-09-06, and Dr. Elias Verran instructed Rivermark Lynx medical staff to perform daily pre- and post-activity symptom checks with uploads to the club portal; therefore all continuations must either concern that 2025-09-06 review or occur before that date. I created two plausible, sports‑medicine–consistent continuations: one (dated before the review) that reflects routine daily monitoring data uploaded by the club physiotherapist and prompts a temporary conservative training change, and one (dated on the scheduled review) that reports the formal functional reassessment outcome and a measured minutes-management decision by Dr. Verran; both items reference the named entities (Maya Cortes, Rivermark Lynx, Harborfen Diagnostic Centre, and Dr. Elias Verran) and remain realistic in tone and scope.</thought_process>

<text>On 2025-09-05 the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist uploaded daily monitoring entries showing a small overnight increase in right-knee mid-patellar girth (+0.8 cm), a pre-activity pain score of 3/10 and one 400 mg ibuprofen taken the previous evening, prompting the club to reduce on-court training intensity pending the scheduled one-week review.</text>

Known follow-up events from the history: Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes on 2025-08-30 with a 10–12 minute per-match cap and instructed daily pre/post activity symptom checks, physiotherapy data uploads, and a one-week functional review booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre. The 2025-09-05 monitoring upload in the provided continuation must therefore be consistent with ongoing daily checks, documented analgesic use, and the scheduled 09/06 reassessment; any club action on 2025-09-05 should not conflict with the previously documented minutes cap or the planned one-week review unless the club escalates care. 

I generated three mutually exclusive (contradictory) but plausible, objective developments that keep the central topic (Maya Cortes' right-knee monitoring), the negative/precautionary stance, the local/low-to-medium impact level, and the same date (2025-09-05). Each alternative represents a different one-off course the club could take in response to the same uploaded monitoring data while remaining consistent with the existing timeline and medical instructions.

I reviewed the 2025-09-05 outline against the prior history (events through 2025-08-30) and the entity list.

Checks performed and findings:
- Times and sequence: The upload at 09:12, pre-activity pain recorded at 08:50, formal non-availability at 09:35, and alerting Dr. Elias Verran at 09:40 are internally consistent and plausible relative to each other and to previously established processes.
- Measurements and monitoring: Recording a mid-patellar girth increase of +0.8 cm, the pre-activity 3/10 pain score, and noting a prior 400 mg ibuprofen dose are consistent with the monitoring items Dr. Elias Verran requested on 2025-08-30 (pain score, patellar girth, balance test, analgesic use, and uploads).
- Actions: Withdrawing Maya Cortes from on-court activities and arranging expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre follows the club's prior practice (they previously used expedited imaging and same-day review). Scheduling an urgent clinical review with Dr. Elias Verran within a short window of the completed ultrasound is consistent with prior workflow.
- Named entities: The outline uses known entities: Maya Cortes, Dr. Elias Verran, Rivermark Lynx, and Harborfen Diagnostic Centre, all matching the entity list. The physiotherapist "Sofia Harlow" is not present in the provided PERSONS list, but introducing a club physiotherapist by name is reasonable for continuity and does not contradict existing data. The outline otherwise references roles and portals consistent with the club's documented procedures.

Conclusion: No inconsistencies or contradictions were found that require corrections. The outline aligns with the established history and entity information. Therefore I am returning the story items unchanged.

- The outline names the club's portal twice with slight variation ("Rivermark Lynx club medical portal" and "Rivermark Lynx secure medical portal"). This is an explicitly named internal system. It is not in the existing entities. Variants refer to the same portal; per instructions keep the most complete/accurate version. I choose the more specific form "Rivermark Lynx secure medical portal" (appears exactly in the outline) and classify it as a product (software/service).
- Other named things in the outline are already present in <entities> (Rivermark Lynx, Maya Cortes, Dr. Elias Verran, Harborfen Diagnostic Centre, ibuprofen) so they are excluded from the new list.
- Generic systems (club management system, league portal), roles (head coach), and items (club medical vehicle) are not specific named entities and therefore are not included.

CHECKS:
- Confirmed Sofia Harlow does not appear in existing <person> entries.
- Confirmed no existing entity for the club portal variants.
- Ensured only one portal entry included (the most complete variant).
- No abbreviations to handle.

Known scheduled follow-up events from the provided history: an expedited focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre booked for 14:30 on 2025-09-05 and a one-week functional review at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 (which would include repeat targeted ultrasound, isokinetic testing and a monitored conditioning set). Both of my continuations are constrained to occur on or before 2025-09-06 and directly relate to these planned clinical reviews; I therefore created two plausible, realistic alternatives: one describing immediate findings and a short-term conservative management decision taken the same day as the expedited ultrasound (09-05), and a second describing the scheduled one-week functional review outcome on 09-06 that could follow normal or improved test results. Each summary references at least one main named entity (Maya Cortes, Dr. Elias Verran, Rivermark Lynx, Harborfen Diagnostic Centre) and remains neutral, concise and consistent with typical sports-medicine and team-management processes.

Known follow-up events from the provided history that must be respected: Sofia Harlow uploaded a monitoring entry at 09:12 on 2025-09-05 noting increased mid-patellar girth and a 3/10 pain score; the club arranged an expedited focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre for 14:30 on 2025-09-05 and alerted Dr. Elias Verran for an urgent clinical review to follow the scan within two hours; a one-week functional review at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre is already booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06. All three alternative continuations are therefore constrained to be plausible outcomes of the 14:30 ultrasound and urgent review on 2025-09-05, must keep Maya Cortes as the central subject, maintain the neutral clinical-management stance and a medium-impact consequence, and must not conflict with the existing scheduled 09:00 review on 2025-09-06 (it may be referenced or left unaffected). Each summary is written as a single objective sentence dated 2025-09-05 and presents a mutually exclusive clinical decision (so if one occurred, the others could not).

Potential pairs:
1. N0-S0 (signing of a one-year extension) + N1-S0 (training session dated 2025-08-29). N1-S0 gives an explicit date; N0-S0 is an event description tied to the event dated 2025-08-29, so the signing/announcement can be taken as occurring on 2025-08-29. From these we can derive the one-year span of the extension.
2. N0-S7 (club submitted the roster "that afternoon" and received confirmation) + N1-S0 (training session on 2025-08-29). Both sentences are anchored to the same event date (the events are dated 2025-08-29). N1-S0 gives an explicit date; N0-S7's "that afternoon" refers to the same date, so both points fall on 2025-08-29 and the span is within the same day (0 days).
Decision: Include both pairs as they produce computable time spans (a 1-year contract span, and a same-day span).
</scratchpad>

<time-span>
<ids>N0-S0, N1-S0</ids>
<explanation>N1-S0 explicitly states the training session occurred on 2025-08-29. N0-S0 describes the signing/announcement of a one-year contract extension tied to the same event (event dated 2025-08-29), so the signing date can be taken as 2025-08-29. From the signing date (2025-08-29) and the one-year term in N0-S0 we compute the contract span as one year (from 2025-08-29 to 2026-08-29).</explanation>
</time-span>

<time-span>
<ids>N0-S7, N1-S0</ids>
<explanation>N1-S0 gives an explicit date for the training session: 2025-08-29. N0-S7 refers to submission of the roster "that afternoon" in the same event context (event dated 2025-08-29), so the roster submission and league confirmation also occurred on 2025-08-29. Therefore the two points fall on the same calendar day — a time span of 0 days (i.e., both occurred on 2025-08-29, within hours of each other).</explanation>

<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]
N0-S0:
- Time information: The sentence itself does not state an explicit date or time for the announcement/signing. It is part of an event whose event date is 2025-08-29.
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (from the complete_outline for the event containing N0-S0).

N1-S0:
- Time information: The sentence explicitly states the supervised full-contact training session was completed on 2025-08-29.
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the event containing N1-S0 also lists 2025-08-29, matching the sentence).

Assumptions:
- When a selected sentence does not itself include a date (N0-S0), we use the event date listed for that sentence as the date of the described action (per instructions).
- No intra-day times are given for either action, so we can only determine calendar-day resolution. We assume both actions occurred on their event dates; since both event dates are 2025-08-29, both actions are assumed to have occurred on the same calendar day.
- We assume no implicit earlier/later ordering within the day can be established from the sentences, so the duration in whole days is 0 days.

Absolute dates:
- Signing/announcement (N0-S0): 2025-08-29 (assumed from the sentence's event date).
- Supervised full-contact training completion (N1-S0): 2025-08-29 (explicitly stated).

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences are sufficient under the assumptions above: N0-S0 provides the signing event (date assumed from event), N1-S0 provides the training completion date explicitly.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the time span (in days) between the signing/announcement of the one-year contract extension (N0-S0) and the completion of the supervised full-contact training session (N1-S0).
- This requires using N0-S0 to identify the signing as occurring on its event date and N1-S0 to identify the training completion date. Without N1-S0's explicit date the question cannot be answered; without N0-S0 the start point is missing. Both sentences are necessary.
- Make the question avoid citing the absolute date; include an explicit assumption clause that the reader should use the event date for the sentence that lacks an explicit date.

[Answer derivation]:
- Signing/announcement date (from N0-S0 event date) = 2025-08-29 (assumed).
- Training completion date (from N1-S0) = 2025-08-29.
- Difference = 2025-08-29 − 2025-08-29 = 0 days.

I reviewed the previous response and compared it to the task instructions.

Findings:
- The original response correctly identified dates, made explicit assumptions, derived the absolute dates, computed the duration (0 days), and formed a question that avoided stating absolute dates. It included a detailed scratchpad and a concise answer.
- One minor discrepancy with the required output format: the <results> block in the previous response left <additional_sentence_ids> empty and <additional_sentence_explanation> blank. The current task output format asks to list additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected in the previous response), if applicable, and to explain the unique information of each additional sentence required. Since the question relies on both selected sentences (N0-S0 and N1-S0), those IDs should be listed and their unique contributions explained.

Correction made:
- Added N0-S0 and N1-S0 to <additional_sentence_ids>.
- Populated <additional_sentence_explanation> to describe the unique temporal information each sentence provides and why both are necessary.

No other changes were needed; assumptions and reasoning were retained.

Goal: produce one plausible but incorrect distractor. Correct answer is 0 days because both events are dated 2025-08-29. A good distractor should be believable (use outline details like "that afternoon", paperwork at training facility, 75-minute training) and clearly wrong when compared to the correct answer.

Possible distractor values: 1 day, 2 days, "same week (0–6 days)", "24 hours". Choose "1 day" — simple and commonly mistaken. Make explanation point out why it's wrong (both on 2025-08-29) and mention why plausible (N0-S1 paperwork at facility and N0-S7 "that afternoon" could imply different part of day; N1-S1 gives training duration). Use sentence IDs: N0-S1, N0-S7, N1-S0, N1-S1 to show plausibility.

<explanation>Incorrect — both the announcement/signing event and the supervised full-contact training session are dated 2025-08-29 in the outline, so zero days elapsed.

N0-S7:
- Time information: "submitted the roster ... that afternoon and received confirmation of registration from the league"
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (date of the containing event)
Assumptions:
- "That afternoon" in N0-S7 refers to the afternoon of the event date 2025-08-29 (the event date is the latest possible date for items in that event and is used here).
Absolute dates:
- Roster submission & league confirmation occurred on 2025-08-29 (time of day unspecified).

N1-S0:
- Time information: explicit: "Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session ... on 2025-08-29"
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (also the containing event date)
Assumptions:
- The explicit date in N1-S0 is taken as the calendar date of the completion of the training session: 2025-08-29.
Absolute dates:
- Training session completion occurred on 2025-08-29.

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences are required. N0-S7 supplies the roster-confirmation event (tied by assumption to 2025-08-29) and N1-S0 supplies the training completion date (explicitly 2025-08-29).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the duration between the moment the club received confirmation of registration from the league (N0-S7) and the completion of Maya Cortes's supervised full-contact training session (N1-S0). Both points resolve to the same calendar date (2025-08-29) under the stated assumption, thus producing a definite, simple time span.
- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - From N0-S7: that the roster submission and confirmation happened "that afternoon" (must be tied to the event date to get an absolute date).
  - From N1-S0: the explicit calendar date when the training session was completed.
- Framing the question without stating dates forces the solver to extract N1-S0's date and to apply the event-date assumption to N0-S7.

[Answer derivation]:
- Roster confirmation (N0-S7) → by assumption occurs on 2025-08-29.
- Training completion (N1-S0) → explicitly occurs on 2025-08-29.
- Duration between 2025-08-29 and 2025-08-29 = 0 days.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified absolute dates for each selected sentence (both resolved to 2025-08-29), stated the necessary assumption ("that afternoon" refers to the event date), computed the duration (0 days), and presented a precise question that does not include absolute dates and requires the selected sentences.
- The scratchpad derivation was included and explicit.
- The question uses both selected sentences: N0-S7 provides the roster-confirmation timing (as "that afternoon") and N1-S0 provides the explicit training date. Both sentences are required to derive the duration; therefore the requirement that all selected sentences are necessary is satisfied.
- The original output's "additional_sentence_ids" was empty. To be explicit and to satisfy the instruction to list any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected in the previous response, if applicable), I will list the two selected sentence IDs (N0-S7 and N1-S0) in that field and explain their unique contributions. This is a minimal change for clarity and completeness.

No other corrections are needed.

Changes made:
- Added the two selected sentence IDs to additional_sentence_ids.
- Added brief explanations in additional_sentence_explanation describing the unique information each provides and why both are needed.

- Objective: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for the question about days elapsed between roster confirmation and supervised full-contact training.
- Correct answer is 0 days (both events tied to 2025-08-29; sentence N0-S7 says "that afternoon" and N1-S0 gives explicit date).
- Plausible confusion: "that afternoon" might be misread as referring to a different date, or readers might assume the roster confirmation occurred the day before the documented training session.
- Common mistaken numerical choices: 1 day, 2 days. 1 day is the most plausible/simple miscount.
- Use sentence IDs that support the misleading interpretation: N0-S7 (confirmation "that afternoon"), N1-S0 (training on 2025-08-29).
- Keep explanation short: state why it's incorrect (both events are on the same date) and why it's plausible (ambiguous "that afternoon" phrasing).

Potential pairs:
1. N0-S0 (one-year contract extension announced) + N2-S0 (pre-match physical on 2025-08-29): N2-S0 gives an explicit date; N0-S0 gives a one-year duration tied to the signing announced in the other event (same day). This yields a computable end date and thus a span.
2. N2-S5 (18:00 appointment on 2025-08-29) + N2-S9 (08:00 the following morning = 2025-08-30): both give explicit times but are from the same event (N2), and the instructions require sentences from different events when multiple events are provided, so this pair is not allowed.
3. N0-S7 ("that afternoon" submission on event date 2025-08-29) + N2-S3 (17:25 submission): N0-S7 is vague ("that afternoon") so it does not provide a precise comparable point in time for exact duration calculation.

Decision: Include pair 1 (N0-S0, N2-S0) only, because it yields two specific calendar points when we treat the signing/announcement as occurring on the event date (2025-08-29) and apply the one-year extension to produce an end date (2026-08-29). This allows an exact duration calculation in days.

<explanation>N2-S0 explicitly sets the date 2025-08-29 (pre-match physical). N0-S0 describes a one-year contract extension announced (the announcement/signing occurs in the N0 event dated 2025-08-29). Treating the signing/announcement as occurring on 2025-08-29 and applying the one-year term gives an end date of 2026-08-29. The time span between 2025-08-29 and 2026-08-29 is one year, i.e., 365 days.</explanation>

N0-S0:
- Time information: States a one-year contract extension was signed/announced. No explicit clock time; event is dated 2025-08-29 in the outline.
- Event date: 2025-08-29

N2-S0:
- Time information: Records mild swelling during a pre-match physical assessment on 2025-08-29 (explicit).
- Event date: 2025-08-29

Assumptions:
- The announcement/signing described in N0-S0 occurred on the event date for that item (2025-08-29). The outline associates N0 with 2025-08-29, so we take that as the signing/announcement date.
- The one-year contract extension runs for exactly one calendar year from the signing/announcement date (i.e., from the signing date up to the same month/day one year later). This is the natural interpretation of a "one-year" extension for computing an absolute end date.
- The pre-match physical assessment recorded in N2-S0 occurred on 2025-08-29 and is therefore the reference start point for the interval.

Absolute dates (based on assumptions):
- Signing/announcement date (start of extension): 2025-08-29 (from N0-S0 event date)
- Contract expiration date (one year later): 2026-08-29 (one-year after 2025-08-29)
- Pre-match assessment date: 2025-08-29 (from N2-S0)

Reasoning:
- The question will ask for the time span between the pre-match assessment (the recorded swelling) and the expiration of the one-year extension that was signed/announced on the same day.
- Both sentences are required: N2-S0 gives the assessment date; N0-S0 gives the one-year contract length and the fact it was announced/signed (we need its date taken from N0's event date). Without N0-S0 we wouldn't know the contract duration; without N2-S0 we wouldn't know the assessment date.

Answer derivation:
- Start = date of pre-match assessment = 2025-08-29.
- End = contract end = signing date + 1 year = 2026-08-29.
- Duration = from 2025-08-29 to 2026-08-29 = 1 year.
- In days (2026 is not a leap year): 365 days.

Question framing note:
- The question will avoid explicit dates and instead state the necessary assumption: that the one-year extension begins on the day the club announced it and that the pre-match assessment occurred on that same day. This ensures the solver must use both selected sentences to compute the interval.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified time info for N0-S0 and N2-S0, stated assumptions, derived absolute dates (2025-08-29 to 2026-08-29) and computed the duration as 1 year (365 days).
- The question avoided explicit dates and included the necessary assumption that the one-year extension begins on the announcement day and that the pre-match assessment occurred on that same day.
- However, the previous "results" block omitted listing the selected sentence IDs in additional_sentence_ids and did not explain the unique information each selected sentence provides. The instructions require listing any additional sentence IDs required (including those selected) and explaining the unique information of each additional sentence necessary to answer the question.
- To comply fully, I should minimally modify the output to include N0-S0 and N2-S0 in additional_sentence_ids and provide an explanation of why each is necessary and what unique information it supplies. No other substantive changes needed.

Corrections made:
- Added additional_sentence_ids with N0-S0 and N2-S0.
- Added additional_sentence_explanation: N0-S0 provides the one-year contract extension (duration) and (via its event date) anchors the contract start; N2-S0 provides the pre-match assessment date (the assessment/start point). Also restated the assumption that the contract begins on the announcement day and clarified that the event date of N0 (2025-08-29) is used as the announcement date under that assumption.

No other changes to the question or answer were necessary.

Ideas for plausible but incorrect distractor:
- Use leap-year confusion: give 366 days (1 year + 1 day). Plausible because people sometimes count inclusively or assume leap-year. Support with outline mentions of "overnight re-evaluation" or "following morning" to suggest an extra day.
- Use "until next morning" confusion: someone might add the overnight re-evaluation and think contract runs to next day after anniversary.
- Use specific sentence IDs that could be misread: N0-S0 (one-year extension announced), N2-S0 (pre-match assessment same day), N2-S9 (re-evaluation scheduled next morning), N2-S4 (same-day imaging) — these imply activity spanning into the next day and could mislead to add an extra day.
Choose one distractor: "1 year (366 days) / 1 year and 1 day (366 days)" with explanation that it's incorrect because 2025-08-29 to 2026-08-29 is 365 days; plausible because of overnight procedures mentioned.

Potential pairs:
- Pair A: N0-S0 (event dated 2025-08-29, signing/one-year extension) + N3-S9 (09:00 on 2025-09-06). Both give specific calendar dates (one implicit via the event date). Can compute days between 2025-08-29 and 2025-09-06.
- Pair B: N0-S7 (club submitted the roster that afternoon / confirmation — event dated 2025-08-29) + N3-S4 (08:35 on 2025-08-30). These are on consecutive calendar dates (2025-08-29 → 2025-08-30) so we can compute a span of 1 day (or 1 day + hours if counting to the specified time).
Decision: include Pair A and Pair B. For event-1 sentences that lack a clock time, use the event date (2025-08-29) as the specific calendar point referenced by those sentences; compute day-based spans, and also give hour-minute totals when combining with a sentence that has a time stamp (noting the midnight-start assumption).

The interval between 2025-08-29 and 2025-09-06 is 8 days. If one counts from midnight at the start of 2025-08-29 to 09:00 on 2025-09-06, that equals 8 days and 9 hours (assumption noted because the first sentence gives a date but no clock time).

N0-S0:
- Time information: Sentence states Rivermark Lynx announced signing of a one-year contract extension with Maya Cortes. No clock time given.
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (event containing N0-S0).

N3-S9:
- Time information: The one-week functional review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre.
- Event date: 2025-08-30 (event containing N3-S9), but the sentence itself contains an absolute date 2025-09-06 at 09:00.

Assumptions:
- The announcement described in N0-S0 occurred on the event date for that sentence (2025-08-29). No specific time-of-day is given for the announcement; because the question will ask for elapsed days, we treat the announcement as occurring at some time on 2025-08-29 and compute whole-day difference to the scheduled review on 2025-09-06 at 09:00. This yields an integer number of days between the two calendar dates (ignoring hours/minutes within the start date).
- We assume no other offset (e.g., time zones) is relevant.

Absolute dates:
- Start: 2025-08-29 (date of announcement per N0-S0 event date).
- End: 2025-09-06 09:00 (appointment per N3-S9).

Derivation:
- Count days from 2025-08-29 to 2025-09-06:
  - 2025-08-29 → 2025-08-30 = 1 day
  - → 2025-08-31 = 2 days
  - → 2025-09-01 = 3 days
  - → 2025-09-02 = 4 days
  - → 2025-09-03 = 5 days
  - → 2025-09-04 = 6 days
  - → 2025-09-05 = 7 days
  - → 2025-09-06 = 8 days
- Therefore, 8 days elapsed between the announcement date (2025-08-29) and the calendar date of the booked review (2025-09-06). (If hours were counted from a precise announcement time on 2025-08-29, the duration would be 8 days plus some hours; because no time-of-day is specified for the announcement, the integer-day answer is 8 days.)

Question Idea:
- Ask for the number of days elapsed between the club's announcement of the one-year contract extension (N0-S0) and the scheduled one-week functional review appointment (N3-S9), while explicitly stating the assumption that the announcement happened on the day given in its event.
- Unique required info:
  - From N0-S0: the fact and date (event date) of the announcement (start point).
  - From N3-S9: the scheduled appointment date/time (end point).
- Both sentences are necessary: N0-S0 supplies the start date, N3-S9 supplies the end date/time. No other sentence in the outline provides both pieces together.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start date = 2025-08-29 (N0-S0 event date)
- End date = 2025-09-06 (N3-S9)
- Difference = 8 days

- The original output included a scratchpad derivation and a results block with a QA pair, as required.
- One minor omission: the previous "additional_sentence_ids" field was left empty even though the meta-check output now requests listing the selected sentence IDs (and any additional ones). Also "additional_sentence_explanation" was empty; it should explain the unique information each selected sentence provides and why both are necessary.

- Added the selected sentence IDs (N0-S0 and N3-S9) to the additional_sentence_ids field.

Possible ways a reader could be misled:
- Interpret "one-week functional review" as exactly 7 days after the announcement (common meaning of "one week"), leading to 7 days instead of 8.
- Confuse the announcement date (2025-08-29) with the next-day clinic activity (2025-08-30) and then count a week from that, giving 7 days to 2025-09-06 — still yields 7 from Aug 30 to Sep 6, but that's 7 days, not the correct 8 from Aug 29.
- Use the phrase "one-week" (N3-S8, N3-S9) to justify 7 days; include the announcement sentence (N0-S0) to make it plausible.

Choose distractor = "7 days" because it's plausible (one-week) and aligns with several outline sentences but is definitively incorrect (actual elapsed time is 8 days from 2025-08-29 to 2025-09-06).

N0-S7:
- Time information: "The club submitted the roster to league administrators that afternoon and received confirmation of registration from the league..."
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the event containing N0-S7 is dated 2025-08-29)
- Interpretation: The sentence gives a relative time-of-day ("that afternoon") on 2025-08-29 but no clock time.

N3-S4:
- Time information: "At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes for match selection..."
- Event date: 2025-08-30 (the event containing N3-S4 is dated 2025-08-30)
- Interpretation: This sentence gives an explicit clock time and date: 08:35 on 2025-08-30.

Assumptions:
- "That afternoon" in N0-S7 (the afternoon of 2025-08-29) must be assigned a specific clock time to compute an absolute duration. Reasonable daytime range for "afternoon" is 12:00–18:00. For a conservative, simple computation I assume "that afternoon" corresponds to 15:00 (3:00 PM) local time on 2025-08-29. This assumption is explicit and necessary to derive a single numerical duration.
- No other sentences are added; only the two selected sentences are used plus the event dates attached to each sentence.

Absolute dates (under the assumption above):
- Start point (roster confirmation): 2025-08-29 at 15:00 (assumed)
- End point (medical clearance): 2025-08-30 at 08:35 (explicit in N3-S4)

Answer derivation:
- From 2025-08-29 15:00 to 2025-08-29 24:00 (midnight) = 9 hours
- From 2025-08-30 00:00 to 2025-08-30 08:35 = 8 hours 35 minutes
- Total elapsed = 9 hours + 8 hours 35 minutes = 17 hours 35 minutes

Validation of requirements:
- Both selected sentences are necessary: N0-S7 provides the roster-confirmation event and its day ("that afternoon" of 2025-08-29); N3-S4 provides the clearance event with exact time (08:35 on 2025-08-30). Without N0-S7 you don't have the roster-confirmation start; without N3-S4 you don't have the clearance end time.
- No other sentence from the outline is used to substitute the missing time details; the only extra element is an explicit, stated assumption about what "that afternoon" means (and the assumption is included in the question).
- The question will therefore require extracting the two time points (one explicit and one inferred via assumption) to compute the duration.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified time information from both selected sentences, stated an explicit assumption about "that afternoon" (15:00 on 2025-08-29), derived absolute points in time, computed the duration, and formulated a question that requires both selected sentences. The computed answer "17 hours 35 minutes" is consistent with the derivation.
- One minor discrepancy with the requested output format: the prior response left <additional_sentence_ids> empty.

- Correct answer uses 15:00 (that afternoon) to 08:35 next morning = 17h35.
- Need 1 plausible but incorrect distractor. Make it numerically close but clearly wrong.
- Use other explicit times in outline to create confusion: 17:25 (N2-S3), 18:00 (N2-S5), 08:00/08:15 (N3-S0/N3-S2).
- Candidate distractors:
  - From 17:25 to 08:35 = 15 hours 10 minutes (plausible if reader mistakes the confirmation time for the match-day withdrawal submission time).
  - From 18:00 to 08:35 = 14 hours 35 minutes (plausible using ultrasound appointment time).
  - From 08:00 to 08:35 = 0 hours 35 minutes (less plausible as a confusion).
- Choose 15 hours 10 minutes: close enough to be tempting, uses real 17:25 time (N2-S3) and the roster confirmation sentence (N0-S7) to make it sound believable, but it's definitively not equal to correct 17h35.

The interval between 2025-08-29 and 2025-09-05 is 7 days. Because N0-S0 does not give a time-of-day, the safe computable span at the calendar-day level is 7 days.</explanation>

<explanation>N0-S7 refers to submitting the roster "that afternoon" of the 2025-08-29 event (thus on the afternoon of 2025-08-29). N4-S7 gives specific times on 2025-09-05 (a formal non-availability submission at 09:35 and an ultrasound appointment at 14:30). The span from the afternoon of 2025-08-29 to 09:35 on 2025-09-05 is approximately 7 days (roughly 7 days minus several hours, depending on the exact hour in the afternoon taken as the start). Using calendar days the interval is 7 days; using the provided morning time yields an approximate 7-day interval from afternoon Aug 29 to morning Sep 05.</explanation>

<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]
N0-S0:
- Time information: Announcement of the one-year contract extension. No clock time provided.
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (from the event containing N0-S0).

N4-S1:
- Time information: The uploaded monitoring entry was submitted at 09:12 local time and time-stamped.
- Event date: 2025-09-05 (from the event containing N4-S1).
Assumptions:
- N0-S0 occurred on its event date (2025-08-29). Because no clock time is specified, to derive a precise absolute point in time I assume "the very start of the event date" (00:00 local time) for the announcement. This assumption is stated explicitly in the question so the duration is unambiguous.
Absolute dates (with the assumption applied):
- Start point: Announcement — 2025-08-29 00:00 (assumed).
- End point: Monitoring entry submission — 2025-09-05 09:12 (explicit).

[Answer derivation]:
- From 2025-08-29 00:00 to 2025-09-05 00:00 = 7 days exactly.
- Add the 09:12 hours on 2025-09-05 → total = 7 days + 9 hours + 12 minutes.
- Equivalent totals: 177 hours and 12 minutes, or 10,632 minutes.

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences are required. Both selected sentences (N0-S0 and N4-S1) are necessary: N0-S0 supplies the start date (event date) and N4-S1 supplies the precise end time on its event date. Without N0-S0 the start date wouldn't be known; without N4-S1 the end time would be unknown.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the club's announcement (use its event date as the start, with an explicit assumption about start-of-day) and the medical portal upload (explicitly noted in the second sentence as 09:12 on its event date). Frame the question so the solver must use both sentences and the stated assumption to compute the duration.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified and stated assumptions (announcement assumed at start of its event date) and computed the duration (7 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes).
- The question avoided explicit absolute dates and required use of both selected sentences.
- The answer is concise and in the required format (time span only).
- One minor omission: the <additional_sentence_ids> and <additional_sentence_explanation> fields were left empty in the previous response. The instructions ask to list additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected previously), if applicable. Even though no extra sentences beyond the two selected are required, the response should list the selected sentences as the required ones and explain the unique information each provides. This is a small discrepancy to correct.

Corrections made:
- I added the two selected sentence IDs (N0-S0 and N4-S1) to <additional_sentence_ids>.
- I added an explanation for each sentence in <additional_sentence_explanation>, specifying the unique temporal information each provides and why both are needed.

No other changes were necessary. The question, assumption, derivation, and computed answer remain unchanged.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for elapsed time between 2025-08-29 (announcement at very start of day) and 2025-09-05 09:12 (upload). Correct is 7 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes.

Potential wrong values:
- 7 days, 8 hours, 12 minutes (off by 1 hour) — plausible if someone misreads timezone or DST (but no DST in outline). Slightly weak.
- 6 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes — plausible if someone miscounts days (e.g., counts from Aug 30). Could be plausible.
- 7 days, 17 hours, 12 minutes — plausible if someone erroneously uses the 17:25 match-day withdrawal time or 17:10 pre-match assessment as the announcement time instead of start of day; uses N2-S3/N2-S1 to justify.
- 7 days, 21 hours, 12 minutes — if using 18:00 ultrasound or other evening times; maybe too far.

We want a distractor that is clearly wrong but challenging. 7 days, 17 hours, 12 minutes is a good distractor: it's internally consistent and could result from confusing announcement at start of Aug 29 with a 17:00 event that day. Use outline times N2-S3 (17:25), N2-S1 (17:10) to make it plausible.

Prepare explanation: why incorrect (adds ~8 hours), plausible because of mixing up the announcement time with a late-afternoon medical event. List sentence IDs: N0-S0 (announcement), N4-S1 (upload at 09:12), N2-S3 (submission at 17:25) — these make the mistake believable.

Now format final output.

N0-S7:
- Time information: "The club submitted the roster to league administrators that afternoon and received confirmation of registration from the league..." No explicit clock time given; phrase "that afternoon" indicates the action and confirmation occurred in the afternoon of the event date.
- Event date: 2025-08-29

Assumptions:
- I must assign a concrete clock time to "that afternoon" to derive an absolute duration. I choose a single, plausible afternoon time to make the computation: assume "that afternoon" = 15:00 (3:00 PM) local time on the event date (2025-08-29). This is an explicit assumption that will be stated in the question.

Absolute dates:
- Roster confirmation (assumed): 2025-08-29 at 15:00 local time (assumption).

N4-S7:
- Time information: "Rivermark Lynx submitted a formal non-availability notification on the club management system at 09:35, secured an expedited ultrasound appointment ... for 14:30 the same day, and arranged for physiotherapist Sofia Harlow..."
- Event date: 2025-09-05
- The sentence provides an explicit time for the non-availability submission: 09:35 on 2025-09-05.

Absolute dates:
- Non-availability submission: 2025-09-05 at 09:35 local time (explicit).

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences are necessary: N0-S7 supplies the earlier event (roster confirmation that afternoon) and N4-S7 supplies the later event with an explicit time. No other sentence can replace the unique information each provides.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the roster-registration confirmation (described as "that afternoon" in the roster-submission sentence) and the club's formal non-availability submission (given at 09:35 on the later date).
- Must state the assumption that "that afternoon" corresponds to 15:00 on the roster-confirmation date, otherwise the earlier point is undefined.
- The question should not include absolute dates explicitly (per instructions), but must instruct the solver to assume the given mapping of "that afternoon" to a concrete time; the solver will need both sentences to identify the start (the roster confirmation that afternoon) and the end (09:35 submission on the later date).

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: assumed roster confirmation = 2025-08-29 15:00.
- End: non-availability submission = 2025-09-05 09:35.
- Compute difference:
  - From 2025-08-29 15:00 to 2025-09-05 15:00 = 7 days = 7 days 0 hours 0 minutes.
  - But the end is at 09:35, which is 5 hours 25 minutes earlier than 15:00.
  - Subtract 5 hours 25 minutes from 7 days:
    - 7 days - 5 hours 25 minutes = 6 days, 18 hours, 35 minutes.

Check via total hours:
- 7 days = 168 hours; minus 5.416... hours = 162.583... hours = 162 hours 35 minutes = 6 days (144h) + 18 hours 35 minutes = 6d 18h 35m — consistent.

Problems found in the previous response:
1. The generated question included explicit temporal information that should have been inferred from the selected sentences: it stated "the latter submitted at 09:35 on the later date." Per the task instructions, the question must not include the required temporal information; that time (09:35) is present in selected sentence N4-S7 and should be extracted from the evidence, not repeated in the question. This is a violation of the instruction "DO NOT include the required temporal information. The temporal information must be inferred from these sentences."

2. The previous results block left additional_sentence_ids empty and provided no additional_sentence_explanation. This is incorrect: the answer relies on the two selected sentences N0-S7 and N4-S7, so those IDs must be listed and explained.

Corrections made:
- Removed the explicit mention of "09:35" from the question so that the solver must extract that time from N4-S7.
- Added the two sentence IDs (N0-S7 and N4-S7) to additional_sentence_ids.
- Provided a clear explanation of the unique temporal information each sentence supplies and why both are required.
- Recomputed and verified the elapsed duration remains 6 days, 18 hours, 35 minutes based on the same assumption used previously:
  - Start: "that afternoon" on the roster-confirmation day (event date for N0-S7 = 2025-08-29). Assumption explicitly stated in the question: map "that afternoon" to 15:00 local time on that day (2025-08-29 15:00).
  - End: non-availability submission time taken from N4-S7: 2025-09-05 at 09:35.
  - Duration calculation: from 2025-08-29 15:00 to 2025-09-05 09:35 = 6 days, 18 hours, 35 minutes.

All other parts of the prior response were acceptable (derivation and numeric answer correct). Only minimal changes were made to comply with the instruction about not embedding temporal evidence in the question and to list and justify the evidence sentences.

This sentence uniquely supplies the start event and the phrasing "that afternoon" that requires the stated assumption (mapped to 15:00) to yield an absolute start time.

N4-S7: Provides the end event (the club submitted a formal non-availability notification) and explicitly gives the submission time (09:35) and its event date (2025-09-05). This sentence uniquely supplies the absolute end time that must be used to compute the duration.

Both sentences are required: N0-S7 supplies the start event and its relative timing ("that afternoon") while N4-S7 supplies the end event and its explicit time; neither alone suffices to compute the requested elapsed time.</additional_sentence_explanation>

Goal: produce one plausible but incorrect distractor. Correct interval: from 2025-08-29 15:00 (assumed roster-confirmation time) to 2025-09-05 09:35 = 6 days, 18 hours, 35 minutes.

Find plausible alternative start times in outline that a reader might confuse with the roster confirmation time:
- N2-S3: "submitted the formal withdrawal ... at 17:25" (same day 2025-08-29). A reader might take 17:25 as the relevant timestamp instead of 15:00.
Compute difference from 2025-08-29 17:25 to 2025-09-05 09:35:
- Aug29 17:25 -> Sep5 17:25 = 7 days; minus 7h50 gives 6 days, 16 hours, 10 minutes.

This makes a plausible distractor: "6 days, 16 hours, 10 minutes" — incorrect but believable, tied to N2-S3 and N4-S7 (and N0-S7 for context). Prepare explanation: incorrect because start time per question assumption is 15:00, not 17:25.

Potential pairs considered:
- (N0-S0, N0-S7): S0 states a "one-year contract extension" announced; S7 says "submitted the roster ... that afternoon" which anchors a specific point on the event date. Using the event date (2025-08-29) we can take the afternoon of that date as the signing/registration moment and the one-year extension as ending on 2026-08-29 — a computable span of one year (365 days).
- (N0-S0, N0-S6): S6 says the roster was filed "ahead of the domestic transfer deadline" but no concrete deadline date is provided, so cannot compute an exact span.
- (N0-S5, N0-S4): Mentions of an injury layoff and a "short monitoring period" are relative/vague and do not provide specific dates to compute an absolute duration.
- (N0-S7 alone): S7 contains two actions that occurred the same afternoon (submission and confirmation) but gives no clock times, so no precise span can be computed.

Decision: Only (N0-S0, N0-S7) yields two specific, comparable points in time when combined with the event date (2025-08-29): the signing/registration moment ("that afternoon" on 2025-08-29) and the contract end one year later (2026-08-29). Include this single time-span.

N0-S0:
- Time information: Announces signing of a one-year contract extension; no explicit time-of-day provided. It states this was the club's final roster move before the domestic transfer deadline. No explicit absolute time other than it is part of the event.
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the event date given for the event containing this sentence).
Assumptions:
- Because no time of day is given, assume the announcement happened in the morning of the event date (a plausible interpretation when another sentence says "that afternoon" for a subsequent action).
Absolute dates:
- Under the assumption, announcement = 2025-08-29 at 09:00.

N0-S7:
- Time information: "The club submitted the roster to league administrators that afternoon and received confirmation of registration from the league..." The phrase "that afternoon" is a relative time referring to the same day as other items in the event.
- Event date: 2025-08-29.
Assumptions:
- Interpret "that afternoon" as the afternoon of the event date.
Absolute dates:
- Under the assumption, roster submission and confirmation = 2025-08-29 at 15:00.

Assumptions summary (explicit):
- The event date (2025-08-29) applies to both sentences.
- "Announcement" occurred in the morning of that event date; for an exact computation assume 09:00.
- "That afternoon" refers to the same event date in the afternoon; for an exact computation assume 15:00.

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences are required: one supplies the announcement occurred (no time), the other supplies "that afternoon" relative to the event day.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the club's announcement of the one-year extension and the club receiving league confirmation of registration, using the event date and the interpretation of "that afternoon".
- Make assumptions explicit in the question (morning = 09:00; afternoon = 15:00) so the duration can be computed unambiguously.
- Unique required information:
  - From N0-S0: there was an announcement of the signing (the starting point).
  - From N0-S7: confirmation was received "that afternoon" (the end point and its relation to the event day).
- The question must therefore require both sentences: without N0-S0 you don't have the announcement as the start point; without N0-S7 you don't have the "that afternoon" submission/confirmation that defines the end point.

[Answer derivation]:
- Announcement (assumed): 2025-08-29 09:00.
- Confirmation (that afternoon, assumed): 2025-08-29 15:00.
- Duration = 15:00 − 09:00 = 6 hours.

- I reviewed the previous response and compared it to the task instructions.

Problems found:
1. The previous response included a clear and explicit scratchpad and computed derivation, which matches instructions. However, the "additional_sentence_ids" field in the results was left empty even though the question necessarily depends on the two selected sentences (N0-S0 and N0-S7). The instructions asked to list additional sentence IDs if applicable; at minimum the two selected sentences should be referenced there to show which sentences the QA depends on.
2. There is a minor tension in the instructions about whether the question should include explicit assumed times. Some parts recommend avoiding absolute times in the question; other parts allow explicit assumptions if needed and require that assumptions be stated. The previous response chose to state assumptions explicitly (09:00 and 15:00) inside the question. This is acceptable because assumptions were made explicit and necessary to compute an absolute duration, but it slightly conflicts with the "avoid absolute times in the question if possible" guidance. The user requested minimal changes, so I will keep the explicit assumptions but note this choice.
3. The previous response did not list the selected sentence IDs under "additional_sentence_ids" and did not explain the unique information each selected sentence provides. The task requires that any additional sentences be listed and explained. Even if no extra sentences beyond the originally selected ones were added, the output should show which sentences are required.

Corrections made:
- I will reproduce the QA but include the two selected sentence IDs (N0-S0 and N0-S7) in the "additional_sentence_ids" field, and provide a concise "additional_sentence_explanation" that states the unique role of each sentence (start point and end point). 
- I will keep the question wording and the answer identical to the previous response (minimal change), since the question explicitly states the assumptions and the derivation is valid and was shown in the scratchpad.

No other substantive changes are required.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for time elapsed between announcement (morning = 09:00) and confirmation (that afternoon = 15:00). Correct = 6 hours.

Possible distractors: 2h, 3h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h. Need to be plausible and tied to outline text. Use N0-S0 (announcement) and N0-S7 (submitted that afternoon) to make it plausible. Make explanation mention common misreadings (e.g., interpreting "morning" earlier or "that afternoon" later) to justify plausibility while clearly stating why incorrect.

- Time information: States "The re-evaluation ... was scheduled for 08:00 the following morning" (relative to the event date 2025-08-29).
- Event date: 2025-08-29

Assumptions:
- Because N1-S0 gives the training completion date but not a clock time, I must assume a specific clock time for the end of the training session to compute an absolute duration. I assume the supervised full-contact training session concluded at 17:00 local time on 2025-08-29. This assumption is explicit and necessary to derive a single absolute duration.
- The phrase "the following morning" in N2-S9 is taken to mean 08:00 on 2025-08-30 (i.e., the calendar day after 2025-08-29).

Absolute dates:
- Training session completed (assumed): 2025-08-29 at 17:00 local time.
- Re-evaluation scheduled: 2025-08-30 at 08:00 local time.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the completion of the supervised full-contact training session (N1-S0) and the scheduled 08:00 re-evaluation the following morning (N2-S9), while explicitly stating the needed assumption about the training end time. This requires using both sentences: N1-S0 supplies the date of the training (without time) and N2-S9 supplies the precise clock time for the re-evaluation (relative to that date). Without N1-S0 one would not have the training date; without N2-S9 one would not have the re-evaluation time.

- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - N1-S0: the training happened on 2025-08-29 (establishes the calendar day of the start point).
  - N2-S9: the re-evaluation is at 08:00 "the following morning" (establishes the clock time and that it occurs on the next calendar day).

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: 2025-08-29 17:00 (assumed per above).
- End: 2025-08-30 08:00 (from N2-S9).
- Duration = difference between these timestamps = 15 hours.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response generally followed the required steps: it identified times from each selected sentence, stated an explicit assumption (training session end at 17:00), computed absolute timestamps, derived the duration (15 hours), and included the assumption in the question.
- Minor issue: the <results> block left <additional_sentence_ids> empty, even though the question depends on the two selected sentences (N1-S0 and N2-S9). The task's final output should list any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected previously), and explain their unique information. Listing the two sentence IDs makes the dependency explicit.
- Everything else is acceptable and consistent with the instructions. The assumption was explicitly stated in the question as required.

Corrections made:
- I added the two selected sentence IDs (N1-S0 and N2-S9) into <additional_sentence_ids>.
- I provided a brief additional_sentence_explanation describing the unique temporal information each sentence supplies and why both are required.

No other changes were necessary. The question, the assumption it contains, and the computed duration remain the same.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor. Common misreadings: counting from the ultrasound appointment at 18:00 (N2-S5) rather than the assumed training end at 17:00 → 14 hours to 08:00. Another possible mistake is using the 17:25 withdrawal time → ~14.6 hours (less tidy). Prefer a neat round hourly distractor: 14 hours (plausible, uses outline times), clearly incorrect vs correct 15 hours.

<answer>14 hours</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect: the question specifies the training session ended at 17:00, so the interval to 08:00 the next morning is 15 hours.

Potential pairs:
- Pair A: N1-S0 (training completed on 2025-08-29) with N3-S0 (08:00 on 2025-08-30). Both give specific dates; second gives a specific time. Can compute time span from the 2025-08-29 date to 2025-08-30 08:00.
- Pair B: N1-S0 (2025-08-29) with N3-S9 (09:00 on 2025-09-06). Both give specific dates; the second gives a specific time. Can compute span in days between 2025-08-29 and 2025-09-06 (and include the 09:00 time).
Decision: Include both pairs. Each pair uses one sentence from the 2025-08-29 event and one from the 2025-08-30 event, allowing computation of an absolute duration between two points in time (calendar-date to date+time).

N1-S0:
- Time information: Specifies that Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session on 2025-08-29. No clock time is given.
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the event's listed date).

N3-S0:
- Time information: Specifies Dr. Elias Verran reviewed the ultrasound images at 08:00 on 2025-08-30.
- Event date: 2025-08-30 (the event's listed date).

Assumptions:
- Because N1-S0 gives only the calendar date (2025-08-29) but no clock time, I must assume a specific clock time for when the supervised training session finished to compute an absolute duration. The question will therefore explicitly state this assumption.
- I assume the local time zone is consistent across both sentences (both events are local times in Harborfen).

Absolute dates (used in derivation):
- Training session completion (assumption): 2025-08-29 at 19:00 (assumed end time — stated in the question).
- Dr. Verran review: 2025-08-30 at 08:00 (from N3-S0).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the completion of the supervised full-contact training session on 2025-08-29 and Dr. Verran's review of the ultrasound images at 08:00 on 2025-08-30, explicitly stating an assumed clock time for the training session finish (so that the duration is computable).
- Unique information required:
  - From N1-S0: the training session occurred on 2025-08-29 (the date of the start point).
  - From N3-S0: the review occurred at 08:00 on 2025-08-30 (the exact end point).
  Both sentences are needed: N1-S0 provides the date of the first point (without which we don't know which day) and N3-S0 provides the exact time of the second point.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: assumed training end = 2025-08-29 19:00
- End: review = 2025-08-30 08:00
- Compute elapsed time: from 19:00 to midnight = 5 hours; from midnight to 08:00 = 8 hours; total = 5 + 8 = 13 hours.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The original response correctly identified time information for both selected sentences, stated assumptions, derived absolute points in time, and computed the elapsed duration (13 hours). The answer is precise and concise.
- One minor discrepancy: The <results> block left <additional_sentence_ids> empty. The task's output format asks for "List of additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected in the previous response), if applicable". Even if no extra sentences beyond the selected ones are needed, it's clearer and more correct to list the selected sentence IDs that are required to answer the question. The additional_sentence_explanation was also empty; the instructions require explaining the unique information of each additional sentence that is required to answer the question.

Correction made:
- Added the two selected sentence IDs (N1-S0 and N3-S0) to <additional_sentence_ids>.
- Provided <additional_sentence_explanation> describing the unique time information each sentence provides and why both are required.

No other changes were necessary. The question, assumption, derivation, and final answer remain the same.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor. Correct = 13 hours (19:00 to 08:00 = 13h). Distractor should be believable using other times in outline to mislead.

Possible wrong values: 14 hours (if someone mistakenly uses 18:00 ultrasound time as session end), 12 hours (if someone misreads 07:00 as review time), 11 hours (if think review at 06:00), 15 hours (if think ended at 17:00). Choose 14 hours as it's plausible because outline states an ultrasound appointment at 18:00 (N2-S5). A reader might confuse which time to measure from (ultrasound vs training). Use N2-S5 and N3-S0 to support plausibility, also N1-S1 referencing session length/location to make it sound grounded.

Ensure explanation clearly states why incorrect: because assumed session end is 19:00 so interval to 08:00 is 13h, not 14h; 14h would only be correct if session ended at 18:00 (ultrasound time), which contradicts the given assumption.

Include sentence IDs: N2-S5 (ultrasound at 18:00), N3-S0 (Dr review 08:00), N1-S1 (training session lasted 75 minutes at facility) to make plausible.

Keep distractor concise and formatted exactly as required.

N1-S0:
- Time information: States Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session "on 2025-08-29". No time-of-day is given.
- Event date: 2025-08-29

N3-S9:
- Time information: States "The one-week functional review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06".
- Event date: 2025-08-30 (event date of N3), but the sentence itself gives the absolute booking date 2025-09-06 at 09:00.

Assumptions:
- Because N1-S0 gives only the date (2025-08-29) without a time, I will assume a specific plausible completion time for the training session so that an absolute duration can be computed. Assumption: the supervised full-contact training session completed at 17:00 local time on 2025-08-29. (This is an explicit assumption included in the question; other plausible choices would change the numeric result.)
- Time zone/locale: both times are in the same local time zone (Harborfen), so no timezone conversion is needed.

Absolute dates:
- Training session completion (assumed): 2025-08-29 17:00 (local)
- One-week functional review start (explicit): 2025-09-06 09:00 (local)

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentence IDs are required beyond the two selected sentences. Both are necessary: N1-S0 provides the training date; N3-S9 provides the precise booking date and time.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between completion of the supervised full-contact training session and the scheduled one-week functional review start time, while explicitly stating the assumption about the training session completion time (since N1-S0 lacks time-of-day).
- Unique information needed from each selected sentence:
  - N1-S0: the date on which the training session was completed (2025-08-29).
  - N3-S9: the exact booking date and clock time of the one-week review (09:00 on 2025-09-06).
- Framing avoids giving the dates/times in the question; it only references the events and states the assumption to allow absolute calculation.

[Answer derivation]:
- From 2025-08-29 17:00 to 2025-09-06 09:00:
  - Aug 29 17:00 → Sep 5 17:00 = 7 days = 168 hours

Possible mistaken calculations:
- Using the overnight re-evaluation time of 08:00 (N2-S9 / N3-S0) instead of 09:00 on 2025-09-06 gives 7 days, 15 hours — plausible error.
- Using next-morning review (08:00 on 2025-08-30) as the endpoint gives 15 hours (but not one-week).
- Confusing training session end time (maybe 75-minute session ended at 18:15 if started at 17:00?) — not supported.
- Using the one-week review date but mixing up 08:00 vs 09:00 is the most believable small numerical error.

Potential sentence pairs across the two events:
- Pair A: N1-S0 (2025-08-29 — session completed) with N4-S1 (2025-09-05 09:12 upload) — yields an exact calendar-day difference (Aug 29 → Sep 5 = 7 days) and, if a time-of-day anchor is assumed for the date-only sentence, an exact day+hour/minute span.
- Pair B: N1-S0 (2025-08-29) with N4-S7 (2025-09-05 14:30 ultrasound) — similar to Pair A but to a later time on Sep 5, giving a different span.
- Other event-1 sentences either lack a specific time/date (only durations or conditional statements) and so do not provide a second concrete point when paired with event-2 timestamps.

Decision: include the two best cross-event pairs that produce meaningful, computable spans: (N1-S0, N4-S1) and (N1-S0, N4-S7). Note: N1-S0 provides a specific date (2025-08-29) but not a clock time; the spans below are given as exact calendar-day differences and, where a time-of-day is required to state hours/minutes, I state the interval assuming the date-only point is anchored at 2025-08-29 00:00 local time (this assumption is noted explicitly).

N1-S0:

- Time information: The uploaded monitoring entry "was submitted at 09:12 local time" and is part of the event dated 2025-09-05.
- Event date: 2025-09-05

Assumptions:
- Because N1-S0 gives no time-of-day, to derive a single absolute start point we must assume a specific time on 2025-08-29. I will assume the completion of the training session occurred at 00:00 (start of day) local time on 2025-08-29. This is explicitly stated below and used only because no time-of-day is provided in N1-S0.
- The submission time in N4-S1 is taken as 09:12 local time on 2025-09-05 (absolute).

Absolute dates:
- Start (assumed): 2025-08-29 00:00 (local)
- End (documented): 2025-09-05 09:12 (local)

Additional sentences:
- None selected. Both sentences N1-S0 and N4-S1 are required: N1-S0 provides the start date (training completion date) and N4-S1 provides the precise end timestamp.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the exact elapsed time between the completion of Maya Cortes's supervised full-contact training session (as reported in N1-S0) and the time-stamped submission of the daily-monitoring entry (N4-S1), making explicit the needed assumption about the unspecified time-of-day for the training completion. This ensures both sentences are necessary: N1-S0 yields the start date (but no time) and N4-S1 gives the precise end time; the assumption is needed to convert the start date into a precise datetime.

- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - N1-S0: the date on which the training was completed (2025-08-29). Needed to identify the start day.
  - N4-S1: the exact submission time (09:12) and the event date (2025-09-05). Needed to identify the end datetime.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start datetime (assumption): 2025-08-29 00:00
- End datetime (documented): 2025-09-05 09:12

Compute difference:
- Days: From 2025-08-29 to 2025-09-05 = 7 days
- Time on final day: 09:12
- Total elapsed = 7 days + 9 hours 12 minutes = 7 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes

- The original response omitted listing the selected sentence IDs under <additional_sentence_ids>, leaving it empty. The task requires listing any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question; here the two selected sentences (N1-S0 and N4-S1) are required and must be listed.
- The original <additional_sentence_explanation> said "None." while in the scratchpad earlier it stated the unique information from each sentence was necessary. This is inconsistent and should be corrected by explicitly explaining the unique information each sentence provides.

Other notes:
- The assumption that the training session finished at 00:00 on 2025-08-29 is arbitrary but was explicitly stated in the previous answer, which satisfies the requirement to make assumptions explicit. The task allows making assumptions when necessary; we will keep this assumption to minimize changes.
- The computed duration (7 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes) is correct given the assumption.

Corrections made:
- Added the two required sentence IDs (N1-S0 and N4-S1) to <additional_sentence_ids>.
- Replaced the placeholder "None." in <additional_sentence_explanation> with explicit explanations of the unique information provided by N1-S0 and N4-S1 and why each is needed.

No other changes were necessary. The question, assumption, and computed answer remain the same.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for elapsed time between supervised full-contact session (N1-S0: 2025-08-29 at 00:00 assumed finish) and monitoring entry submission (N4-S1: 2025-09-05 at 09:12). Correct = 7 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes.

Common plausible errors:
- Off-by-one day (counting days exclusive vs inclusive) → 6 days, 9 hours, 12 minutes (very plausible).
- Misreading dates as same month but wrong day difference e.g., 1 day + 9:12 (less plausible given dates).
- Subtracting session duration (75 minutes per N1-S1) → 7 days, 7 hours, 57 minutes (we could craft but risk being too niche).
- Using minutes-cap 10–12 as hours → unlikely.

Choose off-by-one-day distractor because it's both simple and likely. Tie plausibility to outline sentences: N1-S0 (session date), N1-S1 (session length) to suggest confusion; N4-S1 (submission time). Provide explanation why incorrect: actual calculation uses full week between Aug 29 and Sep 5 = 7 days; off-by-one is wrong.

Include sentence IDs making distractor plausible: N1-S0, N1-S1, N4-S1.

Now format final output with one distractor.

<explanation>This is incorrect because the interval from 00:00 on 2025-08-29 to 09:12 on 2025-09-05 spans seven full days plus 9 hours 12 minutes. The distractor likely arises from an off-by-one error in counting whole days (omitting one full day). It sounds plausible because the training session details and the monitoring submission time in the outline could lead a reader to miscount the days between dates.</explanation>

<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]
N1-S0:
- Time information: States that Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session on 2025-08-29. No clock time is provided in this sentence.
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the event that contains N1-S0 is dated 2025-08-29).

N4-S7:
- Time information: States the club "submitted a formal non-availability notification ... at 09:35", and "secured an expedited ultrasound appointment ... for 14:30 the same day." This sentence belongs to the event dated 2025-09-05, so "the same day" refers to 2025-09-05. Thus we have a precise timestamp: 09:35 on 2025-09-05 (local time).
- Event date: 2025-09-05.

Assumptions:
- N1-S0 provides only a date for the completion of the training session (2025-08-29) with no clock time. To compute a single precise duration we must assume a specific clock time for the training-session completion. I will assume the training session finished at 12:00 (noon) local time on 2025-08-29. This is an explicit, plausible assumption (a typical daytime training session); the assumption is stated in the question below.
- No other sentences beyond the selected two are used to infer times.

Absolute dates (based on the assumption above):
- Start (training completion): 2025-08-29 12:00 (assumed).
- End (submission of non-availability notification): 2025-09-05 09:35 (from N4-S7; 09:35 on the event date 2025-09-05).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the completion of the supervised full-contact training session and the club's formal non-availability notification submission at 09:35. Require the assumption about the training completion clock time to make the interval computable; ensure the question states that assumption explicitly so it can be uniquely answered.
- The unique information required from each selected sentence:
  - N1-S0 provides the date on which the training session was completed (2025-08-29).
  - N4-S7 provides the exact time of the notification submission (09:35) and the date of that event (2025-09-05).
- Both sentences are necessary: without N1-S0 you don't know the earlier date; without N4-S7 you don't know the exact later timestamp.

[Answer derivation]:
- Compute interval from 2025-08-29 12:00 to 2025-09-05 09:35.
  - From 2025-08-29 12:00 to 2025-09-05 12:00 = 7 days exactly.
  - Subtract 2 hours 25 minutes to go from 12:00 to 09:35 on 2025-09-05.
  - 7 days − 2 hours 25 minutes = 6 days, 21 hours, 35 minutes.

Problems found:
- The original question explicitly included the later event time "09:35" in the question. Per the task instructions, the question should not include the required temporal information that must be inferred from the selected sentences; it should require extracting that time from the sentences. Including 09:35 in the question reduces the need to use the selected sentences to obtain that information.
- The original <results> left <additional_sentence_ids> empty. The instructions require listing the additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (here the selected sentences themselves are required). They must be listed so it's clear which sentences are necessary.
- The scratchpad and derivation were fine and the computed duration is correct given the stated assumption (training session completion at 12:00 on the date in N1-S0). The assumption was stated; keep it.

Corrections made:
- Rewrote the question to remove the explicit "09:35" time while retaining the explicit assumption that the training session finished at 12:00 local time on its recorded day. The question now asks for the elapsed time between the training completion (assumed 12:00) and the club's submission of the formal non-availability notification, leaving the reader to extract the 09:35 timestamp and the later date from the selected sentence N4-S7.
- Populated <additional_sentence_ids> with the two selected sentence IDs (N1-S0 and N4-S7) and added clear explanations of the unique information each provides and why both are necessary.

No changes were made to the computed answer (6 days 21 hours 35 minutes), as the derivation and arithmetic were correct.

Brainstorm:
- Correct interval is from 2025-08-29 12:00 to 2025-09-05 09:35 = 6d 21h 35m.
- Common mistakes: using the ultrasound time (14:30 on 2025-09-05) instead of the notification time (09:35) — yields 7d 2h 30m.
- Other plausible wrong choices could use 17:25 (match-day withdrawal on 2025-08-29) or 18:00 (same-day ultrasound on 2025-08-29), but those produce less natural-sounding intervals or conflict with dates.
- Choose the ultrasound-based error: it's directly referenced in the same sentence (N4-S7), making it a believable misread.

Potential pairs:
- N1-S0 (explicit date of session completion: 2025-08-29) and N1-S1 (session lasted approximately 75 minutes). From these we can infer the session start time as ~75 minutes before the completion on 2025-08-29, yielding a computable duration (the session length).
- N1-S1 (75-minute session) and N1-S5 (planned rotation under 20 minutes). These are both durations, not specific points in time; they do not provide two time points and thus are not valid under the requirement to compute an absolute time span between two specific points in time.
- N1-S0 with other sentences that say "after the training session" (N1-S8, N1-S9) only yields a qualitative order (after), not a quantitatively computable span.

Decision: Include the valid pair N1-S0 and N1-S1, which together permit computing the session's time span (~75 minutes). No other pair provides two specific points in time suitable for an absolute duration.

<explanation>Sentence N1-S0 gives a specific point in time for the session completion (on 2025-08-29). Sentence N1-S1 states the full-contact training session lasted approximately 75 minutes. Combining these, the session's start time can be inferred as roughly 75 minutes before its completion on 2025-08-29, so the time span between start and end is approximately 75 minutes (about 1 hour 15 minutes).

N1-S0:
- Time information: States that Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session on 2025-08-29. This provides an absolute calendar date for the completion of the session.
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the sentence itself gives this date).

N1-S1:
- Time information: States that "The full-contact training session lasted approximately 75 minutes." This provides the duration of the session but does not give start or end clock times or a date.
- Event date: Not explicitly given in this sentence; per instructions we use the event date (2025-08-29) when a sentence lacks an explicit date.

Assumptions:
- The session referenced in N1-S1 is the same session whose completion is dated in N1-S0 (both sentences are in the same event and clearly refer to the same supervised full-contact training session).
- The session both started and finished on 2025-08-29 (no overnight crossing of midnight). This is reasonable given the context and is required to treat the duration as occurring within that date.

Absolute dates/times (derived):
- Completion (end) of session: sometime on 2025-08-29 (exact clock time not specified).
- Start of session: 75 minutes before the completion time on 2025-08-29 (exact clock time not specified).
- Therefore the absolute time-span between session start and session end = 75 minutes.

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences are necessary: N1-S0 provides the absolute calendar day (2025-08-29) anchoring the event; N1-S1 provides the numeric duration (75 minutes). Without N1-S0 one would lack the date anchor, and without N1-S1 one would lack the length.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the time span between the start and the end of the supervised full-contact training session that Maya Cortes completed on the day it was observed by Rivermark Lynx staff. The question must be answered by combining the date from N1-S0 (to anchor the session to that day) and the length from N1-S1. Frame the question so the reader must extract that the session was completed "that day" (N1-S0) and that the session lasted approximately 75 minutes (N1-S1).

[Answer derivation]:
- From N1-S1: session duration = approximately 75 minutes.
- N1-S0 anchors the session to 2025-08-29; under the assumption the session started and ended on that date, the time-span from session start to session end = 75 minutes.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified the time information in N1-S0 (absolute date) and N1-S1 (duration), made a reasonable assumption (session started and ended same day), derived the duration (75 minutes), and produced a clear question and concise answer ("75 minutes").
- The previous response included a detailed <scratchpad> reasoning and derivation, and the question included the required assumption.
- However, the <results> block omitted listing the selected sentence IDs under <additional_sentence_ids>.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for the question asking duration of the supervised full-contact training session (correct: 75 minutes).

Potential confusion sources in outline:
- N1-S5: coach limited Maya to under 20 minutes in match rotation — could be mistaken for training duration.
- N0-S2/N0-S3: contract incentives tied to minutes/appearances — mentions minutes thresholds, could mislead to think of minutes in training.
- N1-S1 explicitly gives 75 minutes (must not be used as the distractor).
- N1-S0 confirms the session occurred on that day — supports plausibility of any duration.

Make distractor: "20 minutes" (or "under 20 minutes") — ties to N1-S5, plausible but clearly incorrect vs N1-S1.

Prepare explanation: note that 20 minutes refers to match minutes-management plan (N1-S5), not the training session length; training session lasted ~75 minutes per N1-S1.

Select sentence IDs that make distractor sound plausible: N1-S5 (minutes-management plan) and N1-S0 (session occurred) — these imply a minutes figure, increasing plausibility.

Keep distractor wording concise and realistic: "20 minutes" as an exact value is common in multiple-choice.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The original reasoning and computed duration (14 hours 50 minutes) are correct given the timestamps: N2-S1 ≈ 2025-08-29 17:10 and N3-S0 = 2025-08-30 08:00.
- The original question properly avoided explicit absolute dates and referenced the sentence IDs. It included the assumption that "about 17:10" is taken as 17:10 and that the palpation occurred on the event day.
- One minor omission: the question did not explicitly state that both timestamps are in the same local timezone. The scratchpad reasoning included this assumption, but the question itself should state it (the task demands assumptions be stated clearly in the question when needed).
- The previous output left additional_sentence_ids empty. To be explicit and satisfy the current output format requirement ("including those selected in the previous response"), it's clearer to list the selected sentence IDs (N2-S1, N3-S0) as the sentences required to answer the question and explain their unique information.

Corrections made:
- Added an explicit clause in the question stating that both timestamps are in the same local timezone.
- Listed the two selected sentence IDs in additional_sentence_ids and provided a brief explanation of the unique information each supplies.

No other changes to the computed duration or derivation were necessary.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for elapsed time between bedside palpation at "about 17:10" (N2-S1) on 2025-08-29 and image review at 08:00 on 2025-08-30 (N3-S0). Correct = 14 hours 50 minutes.

Think of plausible misreadings:
- Using the ultrasound appointment time (18:00 in N2-S5) instead of palpation time -> 18:00 to 08:00 = 14 hours. Very plausible.
- Using withdrawal submission time 17:25 (N2-S3) -> 14 hours 35 minutes (17:25 to 08:00 = 14h35m) — also plausible, but need only one distractor.
- Using 17:10 rounded to 17:00 -> 15 hours to 08:00 = 14 or 15? If 17:00 to 08:00 = 15 hours -> plausible.
- Using 17:10 to 09:00 misremembered -> 15h50, etc.

Choose the ultrasound booking confusion: distractor "14 hours" (18:00 → 08:00). It ties directly to N2-S5 (18:00 appointment) and N3-S0 (08:00 review). Explanation will note it's incorrect because question asks from bedside palpation at 17:10, not the imaging appointment.
Ensure explanation short and clear.
Include sentence IDs that make distractor plausible: N2-S5, N2-S4 (scheduling imaging), N3-S0. Maybe include N2-S4 to strengthen.
But keep listed IDs to those referenced: N2-S5,N3-S0 (and N2-S4 optional). I'll include N2-S5,N2-S4,N3-S0 to maximize plausibility.

N2-S9:
- Time information: "re-evaluation ... was scheduled for 08:00 the following morning"
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (the event containing N2-S9)
Assumptions:
- "the following morning" refers to the calendar day immediately after the event date 2025-08-29.
Absolute dates:
- Re-evaluation absolute time = 2025-08-30 at 08:00 (derived from event date 2025-08-29 + "the following morning" at 08:00)

N3-S9:
- Time information: "The one-week functional review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06"
- Event date: 2025-08-30 (the event containing N3-S9), but the sentence itself contains an explicit absolute date/time.
Assumptions:
- Use the explicit date/time given in the sentence without modification.
Absolute dates:
- One-week functional review absolute time = 2025-09-06 at 09:00 (explicit in sentence)

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences are required: N2-S9 supplies the start time (relative wording that must be anchored to 2025-08-29) and N3-S9 supplies the end time (explicit).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the re-evaluation (08:00 "the following morning" relative to the 2025-08-29 event) and the one-week functional review (09:00 on 2025-09-06). This requires converting "the following morning" to the absolute date 2025-08-30 08:00 and subtracting from 2025-09-06 09:00.

Unique information required from each selected sentence:
- N2-S9: gives the start time as "08:00 the following morning" — must be anchored to the event date 2025-08-29 to get the exact start point (2025-08-30 08:00).
- N3-S9: gives the end time explicitly as 09:00 on 2025-09-06.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: 2025-08-30 08:00 (from N2-S9 + event date 2025-08-29)
- End: 2025-09-06 09:00 (from N3-S9)
- Difference: from 2025-08-30 08:00 to 2025-09-06 08:00 = 7 days; plus one more hour to 09:00 = 7 days and 1 hour.
- In hours: 7 * 24 + 1 = 169 hours.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The original reasoning and computed duration (from 2025-08-30 08:00 to 2025-09-06 09:00 = 7 days, 1 hour) are correct.
- The original question included an explicit assumption referencing the event date 2025-08-29; this is permitted by the instructions (assumptions may be required and should be stated).
- The original response omitted listing the sentence IDs that are required to answer the question and omitted the explanation of what unique information each sentence provides. The task's output format requests listing additional sentence IDs and explanations "if applicable." Since both selected sentences (N2-S9 and N3-S9) are required, they should be listed and explained.
- No other substantive problems found.

Corrections made (minimal):
- Added additional_sentence_ids listing the two selected sentences (N2-S9 and N3-S9).
- Added additional_sentence_explanation describing the unique temporal information each sentence supplies and why both are necessary.

No other changes to the question, assumption, or computed answer were necessary.

Possible distractors:
- "7 days, 0 hours" (plausible: someone counts days but overlooks the 1-hour difference). Uses N2-S9/N3-S9/N3-S0 for plausibility.

N2-S0:
- Time information: "during a pre-match physical assessment on 2025-08-29" — explicit absolute date given in the sentence.
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (matches the sentence date).
Assumptions:
- The recorded swelling occurred on 2025-08-29 (the sentence's explicit date is taken as the exact date of the assessment).
Absolute dates:
- Start point = 2025-08-29 (date of pre-match assessment when mild swelling was recorded).

N4-S0:
- Time information: "uploaded daily monitoring entries ... on 2025-09-05" — explicit absolute date given in the sentence.
- Event date: 2025-09-05 (matches the sentence date).
Assumptions:
- The upload occurred on 2025-09-05 (the sentence's explicit date is taken as the exact date of the upload).
Absolute dates:
- End point = 2025-09-05 (date of physiotherapist Sofia Harlow's upload).

Additional sentences:
- None required. Both selected sentences provide unambiguous absolute dates necessary to compute the time span.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the duration between the two events (the pre-match assessment with recorded swelling and the physiotherapist's upload of daily monitoring entries). The question must not show dates; it must require extracting the dates from both sentences. The unique info from each sentence required:
  - N2-S0 provides the date of the swelling observation (start).
  - N4-S0 provides the date of the monitoring upload (end).
- Frame the question so both sentences are necessary (one gives the start date, the other the end date).

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: 2025-08-29
- End: 2025-09-05
- Compute difference: count days from 2025-08-29 up to 2025-09-05:
  - 2025-08-29 → 2025-08-30 = 1 day
  - 2025-08-30 → 2025-08-31 = 2 days
  - 2025-08-31 → 2025-09-01 = 3 days
  - 2025-09-01 → 2025-09-02 = 4 days

  - 2025-09-03 → 2025-09-04 = 6 days
  - 2025-09-04 → 2025-09-05 = 7 days

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for "How many days elapsed between 2025-08-29 (pre-match assessment) and 2025-09-05 (portal upload)?" Correct = 7 days.

Common plausible mistakes:
- Counting from the next day (08/30) to 09/05 = 6 days (easy off-by-one or using ultrasound/review date).
- Confusing the one-week functional review date (09/06) and thinking interval is 8 days.
- Using the clearance date 08/30 (N3-S0/N3-S4) or other event dates.

Choose 6 days as distractor: believable because outline has events on 08/30 (Dr. Verran review/ultrasound) and someone might measure from that date to 09/05. Use sentence IDs N3-S0 (08/30 review) and N4-S0 (09/05 upload) to back plausibility. Provide short explanation why incorrect but plausible.

N2-S1:
- Time information from this sentence:
  - A bedside palpation was noted "at about 17:10 local time."
- Event date:
  - The sentence is in the event dated 2025-08-29, so the palpation occurred on 2025-08-29.
Assumptions:
- "About 17:10 local time" is taken as 17:10 on 2025-08-29 (local time).
Absolute dates:
- 2025-08-29 17:10 (local time) — physiotherapist bedside palpation recorded.

N4-S1:
- Time information from this sentence:
  - The uploaded entry was submitted at 09:12 local time.
- Event date:
  - The sentence is in the event dated 2025-09-05, so the upload occurred on 2025-09-05.
Assumptions:
- The timestamp "09:12 local time" is taken as 09:12 on 2025-09-05 (local time).
Absolute dates:
- 2025-09-05 09:12 (local time) — daily-monitoring entry submission.

No additional sentences required.

Question Idea:
- Compute the elapsed time between the bedside palpation recorded at ~17:10 (on the day of the match withdrawal) and the monitoring entry upload timestamped at 09:12 (on the later monitoring day). This forces use of both sentences: the first gives the 17:10 time anchored to 2025-08-29; the second gives the 09:12 time anchored to 2025-09-05. Both are required to compute the span.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: 2025-08-29 17:10
- End:   2025-09-05 09:12

Method 1 (day difference):
- 2025-08-29 17:10 → 2025-09-05 17:10 = exactly 7 days.
- End (09:12) is 7 hours 58 minutes earlier than 17:10 on the same day.
- Therefore: Duration = 7 days − 7 hours 58 minutes = 6 days, 16 hours, 2 minutes.

Method 2 (hours/minutes total):
- Total hours in 6 days = 144 hours.
- Add 16 hours = 160 hours.
- Add 2 minutes = 160 hours, 2 minutes.
- Which equals 6 days, 16 hours, 2 minutes.

Problems found:
- The original response included the explicit times ("at about 17:10 local time" and "at 09:12 local time") inside the drafted question. This violates the instruction: "In your question, DO NOT include the required temporal information. The temporal information must be inferred from these sentences."
- The original "additional_sentence_ids" field was left empty. The output should explicitly list the selected sentence IDs that are required to answer the question (the user asked that these be included if applicable).

Other aspects were correct:
- The derivation and computed duration (6 days, 16 hours, 2 minutes) are correct given the assumptions that N2-S1 is on 2025-08-29 17:10 and N4-S1 is on 2025-09-05 09:12.
- Assumptions were stated in the scratchpad of the original response.

Corrections made:
- Removed explicit time values from the question; instead the question references the two sentence IDs (N2-S1 and N4-S1) and states the required assumptions (that each occurred on its sentence's event date). This forces the solver to extract the times from those sentences.
- Added the selected sentence IDs to the "additional_sentence_ids" field.
- Added an "additional_sentence_explanation" that specifies the unique temporal information contained in each required sentence and why it is needed.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for elapsed time between bedside palpation at ~17:10 on 2025-08-29 (N2-S1) and monitoring-entry upload at 09:12 on 2025-09-05 (N4-S1). Correct answer is 6 days, 16 hours, 2 minutes.

Look for plausible alternate timestamps in outline that a reader might confuse with 09:12. Candidate lines:
- N4-S7: "submitted a formal non-availability notification on the club management system at 09:35" — close to 09:12, easy to confuse.
- N4-S9: "alerted via encrypted email and an urgent phone call at 09:40" — also close.
- N2-S6/N2-S7 had times? N2-S1 is 17:10; N2-S3 had 17:25 (withdrawal) — another possible confusion (17:25 on 29th).
Compute plausible distractor using 09:35 (N4-S7) with palpation 17:10 -> difference = 7 days minus (17:10 to 09:35 = 7h35m) => 6d 16h 25m. This is close to correct but incorrect by 23 minutes; it's plausible because N4-S7 contains 09:35 timestamp.

Make explanation: distractor is incorrect because the monitoring upload time is 09:12 (N4-S1), not 09:35; but plausible because N4-S7 records a 09:35 club action. Use sentence IDs N2-S1 and N4-S7 to justify plausibility.

- Event date: The containing event is dated 2025-08-29.
Assumptions:
- "About 17:10 local time" is treated as 17:10 exact for the purpose of computing an elapsed duration. (This is a reasonable and explicitly stated approximation in the sentence.)
Absolute dates:
- Start point = 2025-08-29 17:10 (local time)

N2-S3:
- Time information: formal withdrawal was submitted "at 17:25" (and arena match officials informed shortly thereafter).
- Event date: The containing event is dated 2025-08-29.
Assumptions:
- The time 17:25 is on the same event date (2025-08-29).
Absolute dates:

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences provide the unique required timestamps: the bedside palpation time (N2-S1) and the formal withdrawal submission time (N2-S3). Both are necessary; without either timestamp the duration cannot be computed.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified the two timestamps (N2-S1 ≈17:10 and N2-S3 17:25) and anchored them to the event date (2025-08-29).
- It stated the necessary assumption that "about 17:10" is treated as 17:10 and that both times occur on the same event date.
- It computed the elapsed time (15 minutes) correctly and produced a question that avoids giving the absolute times.
- The response included the required derivation in the scratchpad and met the constraint that all selected sentences are necessary.

Minor adjustment (purely clarifying / minimal change):
- The output field "additional_sentence_ids" in the previous response was left empty. To be explicit and to follow the user's instruction in this checking step ("including those selected in the previous response, if applicable"), I will list the two selected sentence IDs (N2-S1 and N2-S3) in that field and explicitly explain that each is required and why.

No other corrections are necessary. I will reproduce the question and concise answer unchanged and add the explicit listing of the sentence IDs and explanations.

Assumptions reiterated:
- "About 17:10" is treated as 17:10 exactly for computing elapsed time.
- Both timestamps are on the same event date (2025-08-29).

<additional_sentence_ids>[N2-S1, N2-S3]</additional_sentence_ids>
<additional_sentence_explanation>N2-S1 provides the start time ("at about 17:10") when the physiotherapist noted the suprapatellar fluid wave — this is required to determine the starting point. N2-S3 provides the end time ("at 17:25") when the formal withdrawal was submitted — this is required to determine the ending point. Both sentences are necessary; without either one the elapsed time cannot be computed.

Potential misreads: compare the 17:10 palpation time to another time in the outline.
Times available: 17:10 (palpation), 17:25 (withdrawal), 18:00 (ultrasound).
Correct is 15 minutes (17:10 → 17:25). A plausible distractor could be 50 minutes (17:10 → 18:00), since the outline mentions the ultrasound booked at 18:00. Use N2-S1 and N2-S5 to make it convincing.
Make brief explanation stating why it's wrong: actual withdrawal was at 17:25, not 18:00.

N2-S5:
- Time information: Appointment booked for 18:00 at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre.
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (event header).
Assumptions:
- The 18:00 appointment occurred on the event date (2025-08-29) because the sentence is within the event dated 2025-08-29.
Absolute dates:
- Ultrasound appointment = 2025-08-29 at 18:00 (local time).

N2-S9:
- Time information: Re-evaluation scheduled for 08:00 "the following morning."
- Event date: 2025-08-29 (event header).
Assumptions:
- "The following morning" refers to the morning after 2025-08-29, i.e., 2025-08-30 at 08:00.
- Both times are in the same local time zone and there are no intervening daylight-saving changes.
Absolute dates:
- Re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran = 2025-08-30 at 08:00 (local time).

Additional sentences:
- None required.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the Harborfen Diagnostic Centre ultrasound appointment (booked for 18:00) and the re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran scheduled for the following morning at 08:00. The question must be answered by extracting the times from N2-S5 and N2-S9 and converting "the following morning" into the next calendar day relative to the event date.

- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - N2-S5 provides the appointment time (18:00) and the location/time context (Harborfen Diagnostic Centre appointment).
  - N2-S9 provides that the re-evaluation is at 08:00 "the following morning" (relative to the event containing N2-S5).
Both are necessary: without N2-S5 we don't know the initial appointment time; without N2-S9 we don't know it is the next morning at 08:00.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: 2025-08-29 18:00 (ultrasound appointment)
- End: 2025-08-30 08:00 (re-evaluation the following morning)
- Duration = End − Start = 14 hours.

Problems found:
- The original response omitted the selected sentence IDs (N2-S5 and N2-S9) from the <additional_sentence_ids> field in the results. The task-check expects the selected sentences to be listed there (the instructions for this check requested listing selected sentence IDs if applicable).
- The original question did not explicitly state the assumptions required to convert "the following morning" into a concrete time. The task instructions require that assumptions needed to answer the question be stated clearly in the question.
- Otherwise the original derivation, absolute times, and final duration (14 hours) were correct and compliant.

Corrections made:
- Added an explicit assumption into the question text: that the 18:00 appointment occurred on the same day referenced in the event and that "the following morning" is the next calendar day at 08:00.
- Listed the two selected sentence IDs (N2-S5 and N2-S9) in <additional_sentence_ids>.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for elapsed time between 18:00 ultrasound and 08:00 re-evaluation (correct = 14 hours). Common misreads: interpret "following morning" as 06:00 (12 hours), or think "overnight" implies ~10 hours, or confuse same-day with next-day (24 hours). Best choice: 12 hours — simple arithmetic error (18:00 → 06:00) is believable and uses "overnight"/"following morning" ambiguity. Use outline sentences that support plausibility: N2-S5 (18:00), N2-S9 (08:00), N2-S8 (overnight re-evaluation scheduled), N2-S4 (same-day ultrasound scheduling). Provide brief explanation why incorrect but plausible.

Potential pairs across events:
- Pair A: N3-S9 (09:00 on 2025-09-06) with N4-S1 (09:12 on 2025-09-05) — both give explicit date+time; can compute an exact duration (~23 h 48 m).
- Pair B: N3-S4 (08:35 on 2025-08-30) with N4-S7 (14:30 on 2025-09-05) — explicit times and dates across events; can compute exact duration (several days + hours).

- Event date: 2025-08-30 (event containing N3-S9), but the sentence itself gives an absolute future booking date.
Assumptions:
- Interpret the booking as explicitly scheduled for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 local time at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre (no timezone conversion needed).
Absolute dates:
- Review booking = 2025-09-06 09:00 (local time).

N4-S1:
- Time information: "The uploaded entry was submitted at 09:12 local time ..."; the containing event date is 2025-09-05.
- Event date: 2025-09-05.
Assumptions:
- The submission time refers to 09:12 on 2025-09-05 local time (the event date).
- Both timestamps are in the same local time zone (Harborfen local time).
Absolute dates:
- Upload submission = 2025-09-05 09:12 (local time).

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences provide the unique necessary absolute times.

Question Idea:
- Ask for elapsed time between the physiotherapist's time-stamped daily-monitoring upload and the scheduled one-week functional review booking. This requires extracting the timestamp from N4-S1 (2025-09-05 09:12) and the booking time from N3-S9 (2025-09-06 09:00) and computing the interval.
- Both sentences are required: N4-S1 gives the upload time; N3-S9 gives the review booking time. Neither alone suffices.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start = 2025-09-05 09:12
- End = 2025-09-06 09:00
- From 2025-09-05 09:12 to 2025-09-06 09:12 = 24 hours.
- End is 12 minutes earlier than 09:12, so subtract 12 minutes.
- Duration = 24 hours − 12 minutes = 23 hours 48 minutes.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified and extracted absolute times from the two selected sentences:
  - N4-S1 → 2025-09-05 09:12 (assumed local)
  - N3-S9 → 2025-09-06 09:00 (explicit in sentence)
- The computed duration (23 hours 48 minutes) is correct: from 2025-09-05 09:12 to 2025-09-06 09:00 = 24 hours − 12 minutes = 23 hours 48 minutes.
- The question avoids explicitly stating absolute dates/times and requests the interval calculation, with an explicit assumption that both timestamps are local — this matches instructions.
- All selected sentences are required to answer the question: N4-S1 provides the upload timestamp; N3-S9 provides the review booking time. Neither alone suffices.
- The answer is presented as a concise duration only, as required.

Minor discrepancy:
- The previous results block left additional_sentence_ids and additional_sentence_explanation empty. The task asks to list any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected in the previous response) "if applicable" and to explain unique information. Since the question depends explicitly on the two selected sentences, it's clearer and more robust to list them in additional_sentence_ids and explain why each is needed.

Corrections made:
- I left the question and the computed answer unchanged (they were already correct).
- I added the two selected sentence IDs (N3-S9 and N4-S1) in the additional_sentence_ids field and provided an explanation of the unique information each sentence supplies and why they are both necessary.

Derivation (concise):
- Start = N4-S1 = 2025-09-05 09:12 (submission time on event date 2025-09-05)
- End = N3-S9 = 2025-09-06 09:00 (booked review time)
- Interval = 2025-09-05 09:12 → 2025-09-06 09:12 = 24:00; subtract 12 minutes = 23:48.

No other changes necessary.

We need one plausible but incorrect distractor. Correct difference: from 09:12 on 2025-09-05 to 09:00 on 2025-09-06 = 23 hours 48 minutes.

Common miscalculations:
- Rounding to 24 hours (24:00) then adding/subtracting minutes -> 24 hours - 12 minutes = 23:48 (correct). Mistake: 24 hours + 12 minutes = 24:12 (if someone adds instead of subtracting).
- Using other nearby timestamps (09:35, 09:40) could produce 23h25m or 23h20m — plausible but maybe too similar.
- Using 09:12 on 09/05 to 09:00 same day -> 12 minutes (obvious wrong).
We want plausible and challenging. I'll pick "24 hours 12 minutes" as distractor: someone might mistakenly treat 09:12 to 09:00 as 24h + (00:00 - 09:12 + 12 min?) or invert sign. It uses the same two sentences to seem plausible.

- Event date: 2025-08-30 (the event containing N3-S4)
Assumptions:
- The timestamp 08:35 applies on the event date 2025-08-30.
- Local time zone is consistent with the other event (no DST or timezone shifts).
Absolute dates:
- Start = 2025-08-30 08:35 (local time).

- Event date: 2025-09-05 (the event containing N4-S7)
Assumptions:
- The timestamp 09:35 applies on the event date 2025-09-05 (i.e., "at 09:35" = 2025-09-05 09:35 local time).
- "The same day" referring to the 14:30 ultrasound also means 2025-09-05 14:30, but for this question we will use the 09:35 submission time as the end point.
- Local time zone is consistent with the start time (no DST or timezone shifts).
Absolute dates:
- End = 2025-09-05 09:35 (local time).
- (Additional time mentioned but not used for the end point: 2025-09-05 14:30 ultrasound appointment.)

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences provide the unique start and end times needed.

Question Idea:
- Ask for elapsed time between the clearance by Dr. Verran (time given in N3-S4) and the club's formal non-availability submission (time given in N4-S7).
- This requires extracting the absolute timestamps from both selected sentences and computing the difference.
- Ensure the question does not state the dates/times but references the sentences and states assumptions (that each quoted time applies on its sentence's event date and local time).

[Answer derivation]:
- Start = 2025-08-30 08:35
- End   = 2025-09-05 09:35
Compute difference:
- From 2025-08-30 08:35 to 2025-09-05 08:35 = 6 days exactly (30 Aug → 5 Sep = 6 days).
- Add from 08:35 to 09:35 = 1 hour.

Possible mistaken calculations:
- Forgetting to include one of the boundary days (counting Aug 31–Sep5 as 5 days instead of Aug30→Sep5 as 6).
- Misreading times: 08:35 → 09:35 as - (crossing midnight?) leading to 23 hours instead of +1 hour.
- Common near-miss: 5 days 23 hours (off by 2 hours), or 6 days 0 hours (omitting the extra hour).

Choose a single distractor that is close and plausible: "5 days 23 hours" fits — sounds like someone counted 5 full days and 23 hours (an easy off-by-2-hours error if they subtracted times incorrectly). Use sentences N3-S4 and N4-S7 to ground plausibility (they contain the times/dates).

- Time information: "At 08:15 on 2025-08-30" — Dr. Elias Verran performed a repeat clinical examination.
- Event date: 2025-08-30

Assumptions:
- Both timestamps are in the same local time zone (no timezone conversions required).
- Both times are on the same calendar date as stated (2025-08-30); no ambiguity about dates.

Absolute dates:
- Start: 2025-08-30 at 08:00 (review of ultrasound images) — from N3-S0.
- End: 2025-08-30 at 08:15 (repeat clinical examination) — from N3-S2.

Additional sentences:
- None required. Both selected sentences provide the distinct absolute time points needed.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the two actions described: the review of the ultrasound images and the subsequent repeat clinical exam performed by Dr. Elias Verran.
- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - N3-S0 supplies the start time (when the images were reviewed).
  - N3-S2 supplies the end time (when the repeat clinical exam was performed).
- Framing the question without giving times/dates explicitly ensures the solver must extract the two timestamps from the two sentences and compute their difference.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start = 08:00 on 2025-08-30
- End = 08:15 on 2025-08-30
- Elapsed = End − Start = 15 minutes

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The selected sentences (N3-S0 and N3-S2) were correctly identified and contain explicit absolute times on the same date.
- The derived absolute times (08:00 and 08:15 on 2025-08-30) are correct and the computed duration (15 minutes) is correct.
- The question phrasing avoids restating the times/dates and requires extracting both timestamps from the selected sentences to compute the span.
- All required steps and assumptions were addressed in the original scratchpad (notably assumption about same time zone and same date), and these remain valid.
- Minor improvement: explicitly list the sentence IDs used to answer the question in the "additional_sentence_ids" field so it's clear which items are required.

No substantive corrections to the reasoning or answer are necessary. I will reproduce the question and answer, and include the two selected sentence IDs with brief explanations of the unique information they provide.

Assumptions (kept explicit):
- Both timestamps are in the same local time zone and on the same calendar date (2025-08-30).
- No timezone conversions are required.

Goal: produce one plausible but incorrect distractor. Correct answer is 15 minutes (08:00 -> 08:15). Good distractor should reference other timepoints in the outline to seem believable. Candidate wrong times:
- 35 minutes (08:00 -> 08:35) — ties review time to the clearance time (N3-S4). Very plausible because reader might mistake "cleared at 08:35" as the repeat exam time.
- 20 minutes (common near 15, could come from minutes cap 10–12? less tied)
- 0 minutes (if someone thinks review and exam were simultaneous) — less plausible given listed times.
- 75 minutes (from the 75-minute training session N1-S1) — unrelated but could mislead.

Best choice: 35 minutes because it uses actual timestamps from the outline and is clearly incorrect. Use sentence IDs that make it plausible: N3-S0 (08:00 review) and N3-S4 (08:35 cleared). Avoid including N3-S2 (08:15) because that would contradict. Provide concise explanation why incorrect: repeat exam occurred at 08:15, not at 08:35; 35 minutes is time to clearance, not time to exam. Include distractor-sentences listing N3-S0,N3-S4.

N3-S0:
- Time information: "At 08:00 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran reviewed the focused musculoskeletal ultrasound images..."
- Event date: 2025-08-30 (matches the explicit timestamp in sentence)

N3-S9:
- Time information: "The one-week functional review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06..."
- Event date: 2025-08-30 (event date is earlier than the booked review; the sentence itself gives the later date)

Assumptions:
- Both timestamps are given in the same local time zone (Harborfen local time). No cross-timezone adjustments are required.
- The times are exact instants: start = 2025-08-30 08:00, end = 2025-09-06 09:00.

Absolute dates:
- Start: 2025-08-30 at 08:00 (from N3-S0).
- End: 2025-09-06 at 09:00 (from N3-S9).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between Dr. Verran's ultrasound review (the instant in N3-S0) and the scheduled one-week functional review (the booked time in N3-S9).
- This requires both sentences because N3-S0 provides the start instant and N3-S9 provides the end instant. No other sentence gives both instants.

[Answer derivation]:
- From 2025-08-30 08:00 to 2025-09-06 08:00 = 7 days exactly.
- From 2025-09-06 08:00 to 2025-09-06 09:00 = 1 hour.
- Total = 7 days + 1 hour = 7 days 1 hour (equivalently 169 hours).

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The original reasoning and computed duration are correct: start = 2025-08-30 08:00 (N3-S0), end = 2025-09-06 09:00 (N3-S9), elapsed = 7 days + 1 hour = 7 days 1 hour.
- The question avoids explicit dates/times and requires both selected sentences to answer — good.
- One minor discrepancy: the final output left <additional_sentence_ids> empty, but the user checklist in this follow-up asked to include the sentence IDs selected in the previous response. To be explicit and fully traceable, I should list the selected sentence IDs (N3-S0 and N3-S9) in additional_sentence_ids and provide an explanation for the unique information each supplies.
- Assumptions in the original scratchpad (same local timezone, treating times as exact instants) were present and should be preserved; they are restated here in the scratchpad.

Corrections made:
- Added the selected sentence IDs (N3-S0 and N3-S9) to additional_sentence_ids.
- Added additional_sentence_explanation describing the unique time information each sentence provides and why both are necessary.

Assumptions (preserved):
- Both timestamps are in the same local time zone (Harborfen local time).
- The times are exact instants: start = 2025-08-30 08:00, end = 2025-09-06 09:00.

<additional_sentence_ids>[N3-S0, N3-S9]</additional_sentence_ids>

N3-S0: Provides the start instant — the exact time when Dr. Elias Verran reviewed the ultrasound images (08:00 on 2025-08-30). This is required to establish the starting point of the interval.

N3-S9: Provides the end instant — the scheduled time for the one-week functional review (09:00 on 2025-09-06). This is required to establish the ending point of the interval.

Both sentences are necessary because neither alone supplies both endpoints; the duration can only be computed by combining the start time from N3-S0 with the end time from N3-S9. The calculation assumes both times are in the same local timezone and are exact instants.

Possible distractor ideas:
- "7 days" — very plausible because N3-S8 says "scheduled a one-week functional review"; someone might interpret one-week as exactly 7 days, ignoring the extra hour. Uses N3-S0 (start time) + N3-S8 (one-week).
- "6 days 23 hours" — also plausible if someone miscalculates time zones or subtracts wrong, but less tied to explicit text.
- "8 days" or "7 days 24 hours" — unlikely; not supported by outline.
Choose "7 days" as best distractor: simple, close to correct (off by 1 hour), and uses "one-week" phrasing to be plausible.

Potential pairs considered:
- (N4-S1, N4-S7): both sentences give specific clock times tied to the same day of the event (09:12 submission; 09:35 notification and 14:30 appointment). Can compute durations between any two times (e.g., 09:12→09:35 = 23 minutes; 09:12→14:30 = 5 h 18 m). Requires anchoring to the event date (2025-09-05).
- (N4-S5, N4-S0): N4-S5 gives "approximately 21:30 the previous evening" and "08:50 immediately prior to the scheduled morning session." Using the event date in N4-S0 (2025-09-05) anchors those to 2025-09-04 21:30 and 2025-09-05 08:50 — usable to compute an absolute interval (11 h 20 m).
- (N4-S5 alone) contains two times, but tuples must contain two sentences.
Decision: produce two tuples:
1) N4-S1 and N4-S7 — compute interval between upload submission (09:12) and club non-availability notification (09:35) on 2025-09-05 = 23 minutes.
2) N4-S0 and N4-S5 — use event date (N4-S0) to anchor times in N4-S5 (21:30 on 2025-09-04 and 08:50 on 2025-09-05) = 11 hours 20 minutes.

N4-S1:
- Time information: "The uploaded entry was submitted at 09:12 local time ...".
- Event date: 2025-09-05 (the event containing N4-S1 is dated 2025-09-05).

N4-S7:
- Time information: "Rivermark Lynx submitted a formal non-availability notification on the club management system at 09:35, secured an expedited ultrasound appointment ... for 14:30 the same day ..."
- Event date: 2025-09-05 (the event containing N4-S7 is dated 2025-09-05).
- This sentence provides two time points: 09:35 (notification submission) and 14:30 (ultrasound appointment), both on the same event day.

Assumptions:
- "Local time" refers to the same local timezone for both timestamps.
- "The same day" referenced in N4-S7 is the event date 2025-09-05.
- There is no ambiguity about AM/PM: times are 24-hour clock (09:12 = 09:12 AM, 14:30 = 2:30 PM) as commonly used in the outline.

Absolute dates/times:
- From N4-S1: 2025-09-05 09:12 (submission of uploaded monitoring entry).
- From N4-S7: 2025-09-05 14:30 (scheduled expedited ultrasound appointment).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the uploaded monitoring entry submission (N4-S1) and the scheduled expedited ultrasound appointment (N4-S7) on the same day. This requires extracting the 09:12 time from N4-S1 and the 14:30 time from N4-S7; both sentences are necessary because one supplies the earlier timestamp and the other supplies the later appointment time.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: 2025-09-05 09:12
- End:   2025-09-05 14:30

Review summary:
- The original response correctly identified the two absolute times (2025-09-05 09:12 from N4-S1 and 2025-09-05 14:30 from N4-S7), computed the difference (5 hours 18 minutes), and posed a question that requires extracting both times.
- Two issues to correct (minor):
  1. The results block should list the sentence IDs required to answer the question. The prior response left additional_sentence_ids empty; it should explicitly list the selected sentence IDs (N4-S1 and N4-S7).
  2. The results block should include explanations of the unique information each sentence supplies (additional_sentence_explanation). The prior response left that empty; I will add concise explanations clarifying why each sentence is necessary.

No other changes are needed. Assumptions from the original response (same local timezone; "same day" = event date 2025-09-05; 24-hour times) remain valid and are preserved implicitly in the question text.

Corrections made:
- Added N4-S1 and N4-S7 to additional_sentence_ids.
- Supplied a brief explanation for each sentence saying what unique temporal information it supplies and why both are required.

All other content (question wording and computed answer) left unchanged.

Possible common mistakes:
- Using the 09:35 time from N4-S7 (formal non-availability submission) as the start instead of the 09:12 upload time → elapsed = 14:30 − 09:35 = 4h55m. Plausible because both times are in the outline.
- Rounding or misreading 09:12 as 09:30 → 14:30 − 09:30 = 5h00m (also plausible). But 4h55m ties directly to a real time in the outline (09:35).
- Using the times in different sentences incorrectly (e.g., mixing 09:12 with 14:00 if one misreads appointment) → less direct.

Choose distractor: 4 hours 55 minutes (plausible, ties to N4-S7's 09:35 and N4-S7's 14:30). Provide explanation that it's incorrect because proper start time is 09:12 per N4-S1.

N4-S0:
- Time information: The sentence states the monitoring entry was uploaded on 2025-09-05.
- Event date: 2025-09-05 (explicit).
Assumptions:
- The monitoring entry upload date (2025-09-05) is the reference date for "the previous evening" in N4-S5 and for the "pre-activity" time in N4-S5.
Absolute dates:
- Monitoring entry date = 2025-09-05 (used as anchor).

N4-S5:
- Time information: The entry notes a single 400 mg ibuprofen dose taken at approximately 21:30 "the previous evening" and a pre-activity pain score recorded at 08:50 "immediately prior to the scheduled morning session."
- Event date: This sentence belongs to the same event dated 2025-09-05; "previous evening" therefore refers to 2025-09-04 at ~21:30, and the pre-activity 08:50 refers to 2025-09-05 at 08:50.
Assumptions:
- "Previous evening" = the evening of the day before the monitoring entry (i.e., 2025-09-04).
- Times are local and on the same time zone; no daylight savings transitions occur between these points.
Absolute dates:
- Ibuprofen dose: 2025-09-04 at 21:30 (approx).
- Pre-activity pain score: 2025-09-05 at 08:50.

Derivation of duration:
- From 2025-09-04 21:30 to 2025-09-05 00:00 = 2 hours 30 minutes.
- From 2025-09-05 00:00 to 2025-09-05 08:50 = 8 hours 50 minutes.
- Total elapsed = 2h30m + 8h50m = 11 hours 20 minutes.

Additional sentences:
- None required. N4-S0 provides the anchor date (2025-09-05); N4-S5 provides the relative times tied to that date. Both are required to compute the duration.

Question Idea:
- Ask: How much time elapsed between the reported ibuprofen dose taken "the previous evening" (relative to the monitoring entry) and the pre-activity pain-score recorded immediately prior to the morning session?
- Unique required information from each sentence:
  - N4-S0: gives the date of the monitoring entry (anchor = 2025-09-05) so "previous evening" can be resolved to 2025-09-04.
  - N4-S5: gives the times (21:30 previous evening and 08:50 pre-activity) that define the two points to measure between.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start = 2025-09-04 21:30.
- End = 2025-09-05 08:50.
- Duration = 11 hours 20 minutes.

Problems found:
- The original response was largely correct in reasoning and calculation, but the <results> section omitted listing the selected sentence IDs under <additional_sentence_ids>. The task's checking step asked to list any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected previously) — it's clearer and safer to include the two selected sentences (N4-S0 and N4-S5) there.
- The task instructions require that any assumptions needed to derive absolute points in time be stated in the question. The original question implicitly relied on the assumption that "the previous evening" refers to the evening before the monitoring entry date, but it did not explicitly state that assumption in the question. I will add a short parenthetical assumption to the question clarifying this (without providing absolute dates).

Corrections made:
- Added an explicit assumption in the question: that "previous evening" refers to the evening prior to the monitoring entry date and that times are local with no timezone/DST complications.
- Listed the two selected sentence IDs (N4-S0 and N4-S5) in <additional_sentence_ids>.
- Provided a brief explanation of the unique information each sentence supplies in <additional_sentence_explanation>.

No change to the computed duration (11 hours 20 minutes); derivation remains:
- Anchor: monitoring entry date from N4-S0 = date of entry (used to resolve "previous evening").
- N4-S5 gives times: ibuprofen at ~21:30 previous evening → 21:30 day before; pre-activity pain score at 08:50 on monitoring-entry day.
- Duration = from 21:30 (day 1) to 08:50 (day 2) = 11 hours 20 minutes.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for elapsed time between ibuprofen at ~21:30 previous evening and pre-activity pain score at 08:50 next morning (correct = 11h20m).

Possible distractors:
- 11 hours (rounding down) — plausible but close; clearly incorrect.
- 10 hours 20 minutes — plausible if someone miscounts the overnight rollover by 1 hour.
- 12 hours 20 minutes — plausible if someone misreads 21:30 as 20:30 or 09:30 AM as 09:50.
- 9 hours 20 minutes — less plausible.

Prefer one that is challenging: 10 hours 20 minutes seems like a realistic arithmetic slip (forgetting to add the 24-hour carry properly). Use sentences N4-S5 (gives both times) and N4-S0 (context date) to make it plausible. Possibly include N4-S4 that references ibuprofen to add plausibility.

Choose: 10 hours 20 minutes. Provide brief explanation why incorrect (actual 11h20) and mention plausible miscalculation; list N4-S5 and other supporting sentence IDs (N4-S0,N4-S4).

  Event 1 options: N1-S0, N1-S2, N1-S4, N1-S5, N1-S6, N1-S8, N1-S9

- Look for combinations that:
  * span both events (required)
  * contain unique, non-overlapping facts about Maya Cortes that would require reasoning over both sentences to answer a question
  * are not redundant with the known-named-entities KB (KB lists Maya's basic profile, not contract terms or match availability)

- Potential strong pairings:
  * N0-S2 (contract terms reduced base salary + gameplay incentives) with N1-S4 (head coach placed Maya on available-for-selection list).
    - These two give distinct, specific facts: contractual financial/incentive structure and match-day selection status. Together they support multi-hop questions like: "Which player whose one-year extension reduced her base salary and included game-play incentives was placed on the available-for-selection list?" or "What contractual changes were recorded for the player the coach placed on the available-for-selection list?"
    - The contract detail is not in the KB or in the other event; the selection decision is not in the KB or first event. Good multi-hop bridge across events.

  * Other combinations (e.g., N0-S0 sign extension + N1-S5 minutes-management) could work, but N0-S2 + N1-S4 is more specific and offers a tighter, interesting two-hop linkage (contract terms -> eligibility for selection).

- Verify guidelines:
  1. Tuple covers both events (N0-... and N1-...) — yes.
  2. Both sentence IDs are from the possible_sentence_ids list — yes.
  3. Both sentences include the bridge entity Maya Cortes — yes.
  4. The facts used (contract reduction/incentives and placement on selection list) are not present in the KB — KB doesn't include contract or selection details — so they are unique facts.
  5. This pair enables a challenging multi-hop question requiring linking contractual/roster info across two separate event descriptions.

Conclusion: choose the pair N0-S2 and N1-S4.

Sentence information: 
- N0-S2: Rivermark Lynx registered contract terms that reduce Maya Cortes's base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for the one-year extension.
  Unique details: base salary reduced; inclusion of game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances; one-year extension.

- N1-S4: Rivermark Lynx head coach placed Maya Cortes on the available-for-selection list for the season opener after consulting with Rivermark Lynx medical staff.
  Unique details: head coach placed the player on the available-for-selection list for the season opener; action occurred after consulting medical staff.

Idea: 
Ask what specific pay components (from N0-S2) were included in the contract of the player described as "the player the head coach placed on the available-for-selection list for the season opener after consulting medical staff" (paraphrase from N1-S4). The answer should be concise: "game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances."

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences required. The identification of the player uses N1-S4 and the contract detail is from N0-S2; both selected sentences are sufficient and necessary to answer.

Verification:
- The question paraphrases the bridge entity using unique info from N1-S4 and does not name the bridge entity.
- The requested information is explicitly stated in N0-S2.
- Both sentences are required: N1-S4 identifies which player is meant; N0-S2 supplies the contract detail.
- The answer is a short, factual phrase and does not mention the bridge entity.

<answer>A guaranteed one‑time signing bonus replacing any game‑play incentives</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the outline states the extension included game‑play incentives tied to minutes and appearances; it did not describe a signing bonus replacing those incentives. This distractor is plausible because the press release and paperwork (and the noted salary change) make a one‑time bonus seem possible.</explanation>

<distractor>
<answer>Performance bonuses tied exclusively to team results (wins and playoff qualification)</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — no sentence in the outline links the contract incentives to team wins or playoffs; the incentives were individual game‑play payments tied to minutes and appearances. It sounds believable because Cortes expressed commitment to help the Lynx compete.</explanation>

<distractor>
<answer>Per‑appearance fees only, with no minutes‑based bonuses</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the outline explicitly notes incentives tied to both minutes and appearances; stating only per‑appearance fees omits the minutes component and so is wrong. It’s plausible because per‑appearance fees are actually mentioned in the document.</explanation>

<distractor>
<answer>Stepped bonuses only for reaching specific minutes thresholds in individual games (no per‑appearance payments)</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — while stepped minutes bonuses are described, the contract also included per‑appearance payments; claiming only minutes thresholds (and no per‑appearance fees) contradicts the outlined terms. The team’s minutes‑management plan and the minutes thresholds mentioned make this distractor believable.</explanation>

I need to produce several false-premise questions that remain similar to the original but introduce one subtle contradiction to one of the selected sentences (N0-S2 or N1-S4). I'll generate three questions:
1) Change "reduced base salary" to "increased base salary" — contradicts N0-S2.

3) Change "available-for-selection list" to "injured list" — contradicts N1-S4.

I need to pick up to 1 tuple of 2 sentences (one from each event) that both include the bridge entity "Rivermark Lynx" and together enable a challenging multi-hop question.

Review sentences that include Rivermark Lynx in event 1:
- N0-S0: signing of one-year contract extension with Maya Cortes.
- N0-S1: club published the extension and completed paperwork with head coach and GM present.
- N0-S2: registered contract terms that reduce base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances.
- N0-S3: details of incentive structure (per-appearance fees, stepped bonuses for minutes thresholds, incremental payments tied to proportion of fixtures).
- N0-S4/N0-S5: medical assessment and monitored return-to-play program.
- N0-S6/N0-S7: filed roster and received confirmation.
- N0-S8/N0-S9: Maya Cortes statement.

Event 2 sentences with Rivermark Lynx:
- N1-S0: Maya completed supervised full-contact training observed by Rivermark Lynx staff.
- N1-S1: session lasted ~75 minutes at training facility in Harborfen and included live scrimmage.
- N1-S2/N1-S3: medical staff reported no pain, normal ROM, functional test results.
- N1-S4: head coach placed Maya on available-for-selection list after consulting medical staff.
- N1-S5: head coach noted inclusion is contingent on following a minutes-management plan limiting Maya to under 20 minutes initially.
- N1-S6/N1-S7: match-day availability notice submitted to league; confirmation.
- N1-S8/N1-S9: Maya quotes and media interactions.

I want a pair that forms a meaningful multi-hop connection across events through the bridge "Rivermark Lynx" and that requires reasoning over both sentences. A strong pair is:
- N0-S2 (contract includes incentives tied to minutes/appearances) from event 1
- N1-S5 (coach's minutes-management plan limits her to under 20 minutes) from event 2

These two together allow questions that require linking contractual incentives (tied to minutes/appearances) with the club's practical minutes-management policy (initially under 20 minutes), both actions attributed to Rivermark Lynx. The KB entry for Rivermark Lynx does not contain these specific operational/contractual details, so the needed information is unique to the selected sentences. This combination yields a challenging multi-hop question (e.g., "Which club that registered gameplay incentives tied to minutes also set an initial sub-20-minute plan for Maya Cortes?") that requires connecting the contract detail in event 1 with the coaching/selection policy in event 2.
</scratchpad>

<ids>N0-S2, N1-S5</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both reference Rivermark Lynx and together connect distinct, complementary facts: the club registered a contract that ties incentives to minutes and appearances (N0-S2), and the club's head coach instituted a minutes-management plan limiting Maya Cortes to under 20 minutes initially (N1-S5). The pairing enables multi-hop questions that require linking contractual incentive structure with the team's selection/minutes policy; these specific operational and contractual details are not present in the known-entity profile, so reasoning over both sentences is necessary to answer such questions.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N0-S2: The club (Rivermark Lynx) registered contract terms that reduce Maya Cortes's base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for a one-year extension.
- N1-S5: The club's head coach said inclusion on the available-for-selection list is contingent on following a minutes-management plan that will initially limit Maya Cortes to a planned rotation of under 20 minutes while monitoring match response.

Idea:
Ask: Identify the specific initial minutes limit from N1-S5, while describing the club by the unique contract-detail in N0-S2. This forces use of both sentences: the description (from N0-S2) identifies the club without naming it; the question asks for the precise minutes cap (from N1-S5). The answer will be short: "under 20 minutes."

Additional sentences:
- None required. The two selected sentences provide the identifying description and the specific minutes limit needed to answer the question.

Verification:
- The paraphrase of the bridge entity uses unique information from N0-S2 ("registered a one-year contract reducing Maya Cortes's base salary and adding gameplay incentives tied to minutes and appearances") and does not name the entity.
- The asked detail ("specific initial minutes limit") is available only in N1-S5.
- Both sentences are necessary: the descriptor identifies which organization is being referenced; the minutes limit comes from the other sentence.
- The answer is concise and unambiguous: "under 20 minutes."
- The question does not introduce any facts not in the selected sentences and does not assume causality beyond what's stated.

I need to produce several false-premise questions based on the selected sentences N0-S2 and N1-S5. Each question should be almost identical to the original but change one small detail that contradicts one of the selected sentences. I must state which sentence is contradicted.

Selected-sentence facts to contradict:
- N0-S2: Rivermark Lynx registered contract terms reducing Maya Cortes's base salary and including gameplay incentives tied to minutes and appearances for a one-year extension.
- N1-S5: Head coach noted inclusion contingent on a minutes-management plan initially limiting Cortes to a planned rotation of under 20 minutes.

1) Change "one-year extension" -> "two-year extension" (contradicts N0-S2).
2) Change "reducing Maya Cortes's base salary" -> "increasing Maya Cortes's base salary" (contradicts N0-S2).
3) Change "include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances" -> "include no game-play incentives" (contradicts N0-S2).
4) Change "under 20 minutes" -> "capped at 30 minutes" (contradicts N1-S5).

- Goal: find up to 1 tuple of 2 sentences (one from each event) that both mention the bridge entity "Maya Cortes" and together enable a multi-hop question requiring linking facts across events.

- Candidate sentences (from provided possible_sentence_ids):
  - From Event 1 (N0): N0-S0 (contract extension signing), N0-S2 (contract terms reduced salary + incentives), N0-S4 (completed medical assessment/return-to-play program after injury layoff), N0-S5 (details of medical assessment), N0-S6 (filed finalized roster with league), N0-S7 (registration confirmed by league), N0-S8/N0-S9 (player statements).
  - From Event 2 (N2): N2-S0 (mild swelling recorded in right knee), N2-S2 (withdrawn from match-day roster following pre-match assessment), N2-S4 (same-day diagnostic ultrasound scheduled at Harborfen), N2-S6 (administered oral anti-inflammatory and ice-compression), N2-S8 (overnight re-evaluation scheduled).

- Connectivity and question potential:
  - Pairing N0-S0 (she signed a one-year contract extension) with N2-S2 (medical staff withdrew her from match-day roster following pre-match assessment) creates a strong multi-hop connection: linking contract/roster status with immediate medical availability. Possible question: "Which player who signed a one-year contract extension was withdrawn from the match-day roster after a pre-match assessment?"
  - This pair meets requirements:
    - One sentence from each event.
    - Both contain the bridge entity "Maya Cortes".
    - The specific facts (contract extension; match-day withdrawal) are not present in the known-named-entities entry and are unique to these sentences.
    - Combining them yields a challenging but clear multi-hop question requiring joining contractual roster action and medical/selection outcome.

- Verify guideline compliance:
  - Both selected IDs are in the provided possible_sentence_ids.
  - The known-named-entities entry for Maya Cortes does not state these specific facts, so the selected sentences provide necessary unique info.

Conclusion: select the pair [N0-S0, N2-S2] as the single tuple for generating a multi-hop question about Maya Cortes linking contract extension to match-day withdrawal.

I need to produce questions that add a single specific unverified detail to the original question. Each added detail must be possible given the context but not confirmed or refuted by any provided sentences. I should base questions on different key info from the two selected sentences (N0-S0: signing; N2-S2: medical staff withdrew her). Make each question otherwise similar to the original and ask the same information (what action the medical staff took). For each question, explain which detail is unknown and why it cannot be confirmed from the sentences.

Potential unverified specifics considered:
- Suspected ACL tear (medical diagnosis) — not mentioned elsewhere, possible, not refuted.
- Contract containing a no-trade clause — contract terms partly described but no mention of no-trade clause, so unverified.
- Withdrawal "for the season opener" — season opener is referenced elsewhere as availability, but withdrawal for that specific fixture is not confirmed.
- Replacement by a named rookie (Elena Reyes) — replacement not mentioned anywhere, unverified.

Ensure each question adds only one specific unverified detail. Provide concise explanations that point out the unknown aspect.

I need up to 1 tuple of 2 sentences (one from each event) that both include the bridge entity "Rivermark Lynx" and together form a good basis for a multi-hop question.

Review of candidate sentences (must pick from provided possible_sentence_ids):
- From event 1 (N0): N0-S0, N0-S1, N0-S2, N0-S4, N0-S6, N0-S8, N0-S9.
  - N0-S0: announced signing of a one-year contract extension with Maya Cortes as final roster move before domestic transfer deadline.
  - N0-S2: registered contract terms that reduce Maya Cortes's base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances.
  - N0-S1/N0-S6/N0-S8/N0-S9 provide related administrative/statement details; N0-S4 is about a medical assessment earlier (also useful but it's within same event).
- From event 2 (N2): N2-S0, N2-S1, N2-S2, N2-S3, N2-S4, N2-S6, N2-S7, N2-S8, N2-S9.
  - N2-S2: medical staff withdrew Maya Cortes from the finalized match-day roster after pre-match assessment.
  - N2-S1: gives detailed knee swelling measurements.
  - N2-S4/N2-S8/N2-S9: scheduling of ultrasound/re-evaluation and specifics.
  - N2-S6/N2-S7: administered anti-inflammatory/ice and ibuprofen, cold-compression.

Goal: choose a pair that requires reasoning across both sentences to answer an interesting multi-hop question using Rivermark Lynx as the bridge. The pair should provide unique details not replaceable by the known-named-entities KB (which only gives general org info).

Potential strong pairings:
- N0-S2 (contract terms reducing base salary + incentives) + N2-S2 (withdrawn from match-day roster after pre-match assessment).
  - This pair can be used to ask: "Which club both registered a contract reducing Maya Cortes's base salary with incentives and later withdrew her from the match-day roster after a pre-match assessment?" That requires linking contract administrative action and medical/selection action to the same club.
- Alternatives considered: N0-S0 (signing extension) + N2-S2 (withdrawal) — similar but less specific about contract terms; N0-S1 (published press release) + N2-S4 (scheduled same-day ultrasound) — could ask about communications vs. diagnostics, but less tight.

I will select the N0-S2 + N2-S2 pair because:
- Both sentences explicitly name Rivermark Lynx (meets requirement 5).
- They come from different events (meets requirement 1).
- They provide specific, non-redundant details (contract terms and match-day withdrawal) that are not present in the KB (meets requirements 6 and 7).
- This combination enables a multi-hop question that links roster/contract management decisions with subsequent medical/selection outcomes, making for a challenging two-step reasoning question.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N0-S2, N2-S2</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences link Rivermark Lynx's administrative roster/contract actions (registering contract terms that reduce Maya Cortes's base salary and add game-play incentives) with the club's subsequent medical/selection action (withdrawing Maya Cortes from the finalized match-day roster after a pre-match assessment). Together they enable a multi-hop question that requires connecting the club's contract decision to its later match-day personnel decision; both sentences explicitly mention the bridge entity and contain unique details not present in the known-named-entities data.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N0-S2: "Rivermark Lynx registered contract terms that reduce Maya Cortes's base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for the one-year extension."
  Unique details: registered contract terms; reduced base salary; game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances; one-year extension.

- N2-S2: "Rivermark Lynx medical staff withdrew Maya Cortes from the finalized match-day roster following the pre-match assessment on 2025-08-29."
  Unique details: medical staff withdrew Maya Cortes from finalized match-day roster; action occurred following a pre-match assessment; date 2025-08-29.

Idea:
- Paraphrase the bridge entity by using the unique contract information from N0-S2 (identify "the club that registered a one-year contract extension reducing Maya Cortes's base salary and adding minutes-and-appearances incentives"). Ask for the specific date on which that club's medical staff withdrew Maya Cortes from the finalized match-day roster (detail comes from N2-S2). Answer: "2025-08-29".

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences required. The paraphrase uses N0-S2 to identify the club and N2-S2 provides the date; both selected sentences suffice.

Verification:
- The question does not name Rivermark Lynx explicitly; it paraphrases the entity by unique contract details from N0-S2.
- The asked fact (withdrawal date) is present only in N2-S2.
- Both sentences are needed: identification from N0-S2 and date from N2-S2.
- The answer is concise and unambiguous.

I reviewed sentences from both events that include the bridge entity "Rivermark Lynx" (only allowed IDs from the provided list). Goals: pick one sentence from event 1 (N0-*) and one from event 2 (N3-*) that together provide distinct, connectable facts about the club, and that enable a multi-hop question requiring inference across both sentences.

Candidate sentences from event 1 with Rivermark Lynx: N0-S0, N0-S1, N0-S2, N0-S4, N0-S6, N0-S8, N0-S9.
Candidate sentences from event 2 with Rivermark Lynx: N3-S6, N3-S7, N3-S8.

Potential connections considered:
- Roster/eligibility (N0-S6) + medical/functional review notification (N3-S8) — links squad registration and clinical planning for the player. This is valid but a bit procedural.
- Contract incentives tied to minutes/appearances (N0-S2) + medical monitoring or physiotherapist recording requirements (N3-S6 or N3-S7) — creates an interesting tension: contract rewards based on minutes/appearances vs. medical-driven monitoring limits and data collection. This supports a more engaging multi-hop question (e.g., asking which club both registered incentive-linked contract terms and instructed medical staff to log detailed activity/pain metrics).
- The minutes-cap sentence (N3-S4) would be ideal to pair with contract-incentives, but N3-S4 is not in the allowed list, so it's excluded.

I selected the pair N0-S2 (club registered contract terms reducing base salary and including game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances) and N3-S7 (Dr. Verran asked the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist to record pre/post-activity pain score, patellar girth, balance, analgesic use and upload entries). Both sentences explicitly mention Rivermark Lynx and provide complementary, unique details not present in the known-named-entities: one describes contract incentives contingent on playing time; the other describes medical monitoring protocols for the same player. Together they form a clear basis for a multi-hop question that requires linking club contract policy and club medical monitoring actions.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N0-S2, N3-S7</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both name Rivermark Lynx and supply complementary, unique facts: N0-S2 describes the club registering a one-year extension for Maya Cortes that reduces base salary and includes game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances; N3-S7 details that Dr. Elias Verran instructed the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist to record pre- and post-activity pain scores, patellar girth, a single-leg balance test and any analgesic use and upload the entries. Together they enable a multi-hop question that links the club's contract incentives based on playing time with the club's medical monitoring procedures for the player.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N0-S2: The club registered contract terms that reduce Maya Cortes's base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for a one-year extension. (Unique: "reduce Maya Cortes's base salary" + "game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances".)
- N3-S7: Dr. Elias Verran asked the club physiotherapist to record pre- and post-activity 0–10 pain scores, a brief patellar girth measure, a 30-second single-leg balance assessment, and any analgesic use, and to upload entries within two hours of each check. (Unique: the specified list of measures and the 0–10 pain scale.)

Idea:
- Paraphrase the bridge entity using the unique contract detail from N0-S2 ("the club that registered a one-year extension reducing Maya Cortes's base salary and including game-play incentives") and ask for a specific, short item from N3-S7 (the numerical pain scale recorded pre- and post-activity). This follows the required pattern: question asks for specific info from one sentence while identifying the bridge entity using the other sentence's unique detail.

Additional sentences:
- None. The two selected sentences contain the unique identification (N0-S2) and the requested measurement detail (N3-S7). No other sentences are needed.

Verification:
- Does the question paraphrase the bridge entity without naming it? Yes — it uses the contract-detail description.
- Is the requested answer a concise, factual item present explicitly in N3-S7? Yes — "0–10 pain score" (or "0–10 scale").
- Is the information unique within the selected sentences? Yes.
- Does the question avoid assuming relations not stated? Yes.
- While the requested measurement is explicitly in N3-S7, the paraphrase identification relies on N0-S2, so the question follows the multi-hop structure required.

<answer>0–5 pain score</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the outline specifies a 0–10 numeric pain score. "0–5" is plausible because several clinical checks recorded low single-digit pain values (e.g., 1/10–2/10), which might be misremembered as a smaller scale.</explanation>

<distractor>
<answer>0–3 pain score</answer>

I need to pick up to 1 tuple of 2 sentences (one from each event) that both mention the bridge entity "Maya Cortes" and together enable a multi-hop question requiring reasoning over both sentences.

Scan sentences that include Maya Cortes:
- From event 1 (N0): N0-S0, N0-S2, N0-S4, N0-S5, N0-S6, N0-S7, N0-S8, N0-S9.
- From event 2 (N4): N4-S0, N4-S2, N4-S3, N4-S4, N4-S5, N4-S6, N4-S7, N4-S8, N4-S9.

Look for combinations that create an interesting multi-hop question. Good candidate themes:
- Linking contract details (N0-S2) with subsequent medical unavailability / imaging (N4-S6 / N4-S7 / N4-S8 / N4-S9) — this yields a question like "Which player whose extension included game-play incentives was withdrawn from on-court activities and sent for an expedited ultrasound?" — requires using both events.
- Another option: link the signing/registration (N0-S0 or N0-S6/N0-S7) with the monitoring entry showing knee swelling/pain (N4-S2, N4-S4) — could ask "Which newly-registered player had an overnight +0.8 cm mid-patellar girth increase?" But N0-S6/N0-S7 (roster filed/registration) plus N4-S2 is also viable.

I must ensure the selected sentences together provide unique information not already known from the provided knowledge base. The KB contains Maya's identity and profession but not her contract specifics or the medical measurement/withdrawal and imaging appointment. So linking N0-S2 (contract incentives/reduced salary) with N4-S6 (withdrawn and expedited ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre) yields a specific, challenging multi-hop connection across club roster/contract and subsequent medical action.

Both sentences explicitly name Maya Cortes. Each comes from a different event (requirement 1). The information needed to answer a multi-hop question (which player with those contract terms was sent for same‑day ultrasound/withdrawn from activities) cannot be inferred from other KB entries or other sentences alone — you must join the contract sentence and the medical-action sentence.

Therefore I will produce one selection: N0-S2 (contract terms/incentives) + N4-S6 (withdrawn and expedited ultrasound).
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>[N0-S2, N4-S6]</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences form a strong cross-event bridge about Maya Cortes: N0-S2 gives specific contract details (reduced base salary with game-play incentives) from the roster/contract event, and N4-S6 reports a club withdrawal from on-court activities and arrangement of an expedited same-day musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre. Together they enable a multi-hop question that links contractual status with a later medical action, and the linking information is not available solely from the knowledge base or any single other sentence.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N0-S2: "registered contract terms that reduce Maya Cortes's base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for the one-year extension." Unique details: reduced base salary; game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances; one-year extension.
- N4-S6: "Following the monitoring entries, Rivermark Lynx withdrew Maya Cortes from all on-court team activities and arranged an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre." Unique details: withdrawal from all on-court team activities following monitoring entries; arranged an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre.

Idea:
Ask what diagnostic procedure was arranged (specific short answer) for the person described by the contract detail (reduced base salary + game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances). This forces use of N0-S2 to identify the person and N4-S6 to provide the procedure. The answer should be concise: "expedited focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre."

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences required. The two selected sentences together provide (a) the identifying description (contract terms reduced base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances) and (b) the arranged same-day diagnostic procedure. Both are present in the selected sentences.

Verification:
- The question paraphrases the bridge entity using unique contract details from N0-S2 and does not use the name.
- The question asks for a specific factual item that appears in N4-S6.
- Both sentences are required: N0-S2 to identify which individual is meant; N4-S6 to state the arranged procedure.
- The requested answer is concise and unambiguous.

I will generate false-premise questions by changing one small detail per question so the question's premise is mutually exclusive with one selected sentence only.

Selected sentences:
- N0-S2: contract reduced base salary and included game-play incentives.
- N4-S6: withdrew Maya Cortes and arranged expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre.

I will produce four questions:
- Two will alter the diagnostic-arrangement details (contradict N4-S6 only): change facility name and change procedure type.
- Two will alter the contract detail (contradict N0-S2 only): change "reduced" to "increased" and change "included incentives" to "did not include incentives".

Each question asks for the same information (the same-day diagnostic procedure) but contains one false premise that makes it unanswerable/incorrect given the evidence.

I need to produce modified versions of the original question, each adding exactly one specific unverified detail that is possible but not confirmed by the selected sentences or context, and not contradicted. Selected sentences confirm the procedure was an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre for Maya Cortes. I must not change modality or location; added detail must be something like probe type, who performed it, or a specific scan technique. Ensure added detail cannot be confirmed nor refuted by any sentence. I will create two questions each adding one unverified detail: (1) "using a high-frequency linear probe" and (2) "performed by an external visiting sports sonographer." Both details are plausible and not present in the text.

I need to select up to one tuple of two sentences (one from event dated 2025-08-29, one from event dated 2025-09-05) that both include the bridge entity "Rivermark Lynx" and that, when combined, support a challenging multi-hop question requiring reasoning over both sentences.

Step 1 — Identify candidate sentences that mention Rivermark Lynx:
- From 2025-08-29 (event 1): possible IDs including bridge: N0-S0, N0-S1, N0-S2, N0-S4, N0-S6, N0-S8, N0-S9.
  - N0-S6: "Rivermark Lynx filed the finalized roster that includes Maya Cortes with league administrators ahead of the domestic transfer deadline to secure the squad for the opening fixtures." — administrative/registration action.
  - N0-S0: signing of one-year contract extension — roster/contract action.
  - N0-S2: contract terms reduce base salary and include incentives — contractual detail.
  - Others include press release, medical assessment completion, player statement.

- From 2025-09-05 (event 2): possible IDs including bridge: N4-S0, N4-S2, N4-S6, N4-S7, N4-S8.
  - N4-S6: "Following the monitoring entries, Rivermark Lynx withdrew Maya Cortes from all on-court team activities and arranged an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre." — medical withdrawal and imaging arrangement.
  - N4-S7: submitted non-availability notification, secured ultrasound appointment for 14:30, arranged physiotherapist to accompany using club medical vehicle — detailed operational/medical logistics.
  - N4-S8: notified Dr. Elias Verran and scheduled urgent clinical review — follow-up clinical planning.
  - N4-S0 and N4-S2 are monitoring upload and measurement details.

Step 2 — Find pairs that form interesting multi-hop reasoning:
- A strong, natural multi-hop connection is between an administrative action (filing roster with league administrators) and a later medical/operational action (withdrawing player and arranging expedited imaging). This supports questions that require linking the club's roster/eligibility action in one event with its medical response in the next event (e.g., "Which club both filed the finalized roster including Maya Cortes with league administrators and later withdrew her from team activities to arrange an expedited ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre?"). That requires reading both sentences and identifying the same organization performing both actions — a classic bridge-entity multi-hop.

Step 3 — Verify constraints:
- Each sentence in the pair includes the bridge entity (Rivermark Lynx) — yes.
- One sentence is from the first event and one from the second event — yes (N0-S6 from 2025-08-29; N4-S6 or N4-S7 from 2025-09-05).
- The specific administrative and medical actions in these sentences are not present in the known-named-entities KB entry for Rivermark Lynx (KB contains general organizational info, not these specific actions), so the combined information is unique to these sentences.
- Both sentences are in the provided possible_sentence_ids list.

I will select the pair N0-S6 and N4-S6 (roster filing + withdrawal and expedited ultrasound) because they form a clear, cohesive multi-hop linking club administrative rostering and club medical response actions, suitable for an interesting question about which organization performed both roles.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N0-S6, N4-S6</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both name Rivermark Lynx and describe distinct but connected actions across events: N0-S6 documents the club filing the finalized roster (administrative/eligibility action) and N4-S6 documents the club withdrawing Maya Cortes from team activities and arranging an expedited same-day musculoskeletal ultrasound (medical/operational action). Combined they support a multi-hop question that requires linking the club's roster/administrative activity in the first event to its medical response in the second event. The specific actions in these sentences are not provided by the known-named-entities entry, so reasoning over both sentences is needed to answer such a question.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N0-S6: The club (Rivermark Lynx) filed the finalized roster that includes Maya Cortes with league administrators ahead of the domestic transfer deadline to secure the squad for the opening fixtures.
  Unique details: "filed the finalized roster that includes Maya Cortes with league administrators" AND "ahead of the domestic transfer deadline" — these specifics (filing the finalized roster with league administrators ahead of the domestic transfer deadline) are unique to this sentence.
- N4-S6: Following the monitoring entries, the same club withdrew Maya Cortes from all on-court team activities and arranged an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre.
  Unique details: "withdrew Maya Cortes from all on-court team activities following the monitoring entries" AND "arranged an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre" — these specifics are unique to this sentence.

Idea:
- Paraphrase the bridge entity using the unique filing detail from N0-S6 (e.g., "the club that filed the finalized roster including Maya Cortes with league administrators ahead of the domestic transfer deadline") and ask what specific medical/imaging arrangement that same club made after the monitoring entries (from N4-S6). The answer should be the concise imaging arrangement.

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences required. The two selected sentences provide (a) a unique identifier for the club (filing the finalized roster ahead of the domestic transfer deadline) and (b) the specific action taken (withdrawing Maya and arranging an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre). Both are sufficient to form and answer the question.

Verification:
- The question paraphrases the bridge entity using N0-S6 only, without naming it.
- The question asks for a specific piece of information contained uniquely in N4-S6.
- Both sentences are required: the paraphrase to identify which club is being asked about (N0-S6) and the action to be reported (N4-S6).
- The answer is a short, factual phrase directly extractable from N4-S6.
- No other storyline sentence is needed to answer; the question does not assume additional relations or causality.

I need to produce questions that add one specific unverified detail to the original question. The added detail must be possible but not confirmed or refuted by any sentences in the full context. Use the two selected sentences as anchors: club identification (filed finalized roster) and arrangement of same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound after monitoring entries.

Potential unverified details considered:
- "under the supervision of Dr. Elias Verran": Dr. Verran was notified and planned a clinical review after the ultrasound (N4-S9), but it's not confirmed he supervised the imaging itself — unverified and not refuted.
- "including Doppler assessment of the patellar tendon": Doppler was used in an earlier appointment (N2-S5) and referenced in N3-S1 for past images, but whether the same-day ultrasound arranged after the monitoring entries included Doppler for the patellar tendon is not confirmed — unverified.
- "bilateral knee ultrasound": context documents right-knee swelling, but bilateral imaging is not confirmed or refuted — unverified.

Each question will add exactly one of these unverified specifics and otherwise remain similar to the original. Explanations will state why the added detail is unknown.

- Goal: pick 2 sentences that together enable a challenging multi-hop question connecting two distinct facts about Maya Cortes.
- Considered pairs:
  - (N0-S2, N0-S5): Connects contract terms (reduced base salary + gameplay incentives) with medical assessment clearance to full-team contact training. Allows a multi-hop question asking which player both had that contract structure and was medically cleared after an injury layoff. Both facts are specific and not redundant with other sentences.
  - (N0-S0, N0-S5): Signing of one-year extension + medical clearance — simpler, less layered than contract-terms + medical detail.
  - (N0-S6/N0-S7 with others): Eligibility/registration connections are administrative; pairing with contract or medical is possible but less interesting than linking medical recovery with contract incentive structure.
- Choose (N0-S2, N0-S5) because they provide two distinct, specific facts (contract incentives and medical clearance details) that together support a multi-hop question requiring reasoning over both contract and medical status of the same player.

Sentence information:
- N0-S2: "Rivermark Lynx registered contract terms that reduce Maya Cortes's base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for the one-year extension."
  -- Unique details: one-year extension; reduced base salary; game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances. These details identify the bridge entity for paraphrasing.

- N0-S5: "The medical assessment consisted of strength and conditioning benchmarks, on-court movement and shooting tests and cardiovascular screening administered over a short monitoring period, with the club medical staff clearing Maya Cortes to progress into full-team contact training."
  -- Unique details: medical assessment components include strength & conditioning benchmarks, on-court movement and shooting tests, and cardiovascular screening; club medical staff cleared her to progress into full-team contact training. These details supply the answer material.

Idea:
- Paraphrase the bridge entity using the unique contract details from N0-S2 (e.g., "the person whose one-year extension reduced their base salary and included game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances") and ask which specific medical screening in that person's assessment cleared them to progress into full-team contact training. The expected concise answer: "cardiovascular screening."

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences needed. The identity in the question is established by N0-S2's unique contract details, and the medical screening answer comes directly from N0-S5. Both selected sentences are necessary: N0-S2 supplies the paraphrase identifying the person, N0-S5 supplies the specific screening that cleared them.

Verification:
- Requirement 4: The question does not mention the bridge entity by name; it paraphrases using unique info from N0-S2.
- Requirement 5: Both sentences must be considered—N0-S2 to identify the subject, N0-S5 to supply the screening detail. Without N0-S2 the subject would be ambiguous; without N0-S5 the screening answer is unknown.
- Requirement 6: Each required detail is unique to its sentence; neither detail appears elsewhere.
- Requirement 7: No unwarranted relations or causality assumed; only identifies same entity across sentences.
- Requirement 8: All phrasing directly follows selected sentences.

I identified key facts: N0-S2 links the one-year extension with reduced base salary and gameplay incentives (Maya Cortes); N0-S5 states the medical assessment included "cardiovascular screening" and that club medical staff cleared her to progress. The instruction is to add one specific unverified detail (possible but not in the text) to make the question unanswerable from the provided sentences. Viable specific details are concrete types of cardiovascular screening (exercise stress test, echocardiogram, VO2 max test). These are not mentioned anywhere in the sentences, are possible components of cardiovascular screening, and are not contradicted by the context. I will produce one question for each type, each with a short explanation that this specific detail is unverified by the sentences.

I reviewed the event sentences that include the bridge entity "Rivermark Lynx" (IDs allowed: N0-S0, N0-S1, N0-S2, N0-S4, N0-S6, N0-S8, N0-S9).

Goal: pick up to one pair of sentences (both must include Rivermark Lynx) that together provide distinct facts that can be combined into a multi-hop question requiring the bridge entity.

Candidate connections considered:
- N0-S0 (club announced one-year extension with Maya Cortes as final roster move before domestic transfer deadline) + N0-S2 (club registered contract terms reducing base salary and including game-play incentives). Combining these yields a clear two-hop question linking the signing event and contract terms — both specific and complementary.
- N0-S0 + N0-S4 (signing + club oversaw medical return-to-play) — also viable, but less focused on contractual detail.
- N0-S1 + N0-S6 (press release/paperwork + roster filed with league) — procedural link but less interesting than contract details.

I selected N0-S0 and N0-S2 because they combine a roster move announcement with specific contractual adjustments (salary reduction and incentive structure), producing a challenging multi-hop question that requires identifying the club connecting both facts. Both sentences explicitly name Rivermark Lynx, and the known named-entities list provides no conflicting info, so the bridge entity is uniquely supplied by these sentences.

Sentence information: 
- N0-S0: Rivermark Lynx announced the signing of a one-year contract extension with veteran point guard Maya Cortes as their final roster move before the domestic transfer deadline. Unique details: announced signing; one-year extension; veteran point guard Maya Cortes; final roster move before domestic transfer deadline.
- N0-S2: Rivermark Lynx registered contract terms that reduce Maya Cortes's base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for the one-year extension. Unique details: registered contract terms reduced her base salary; included game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances; applies to the one-year extension.

Idea: 
Ask what specific salary change was included in the registered contract terms, while referring to the club by the fact that it announced a one-year extension for veteran point guard Maya Cortes as their final roster move before the domestic transfer deadline. This requires identifying the club from N0-S0 and reading the contract-detail from N0-S2. The answer will be short: "Reduced her base salary."

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences required. Selected sentences provide the club identification (N0-S0) and the contract detail (N0-S2).

Verification:
- Question paraphrases the bridge entity using unique info from N0-S0 (the club that announced a one-year extension for veteran point guard Maya Cortes as final roster move before the domestic transfer deadline) and asks for a specific detail that is unique to N0-S2 (the salary change registered in the contract terms).
- The answer "Reduced her base salary." is directly supported by N0-S2 and concise.
- The question does not name the bridge entity explicitly.
- Both sentences are needed: N0-S0 identifies which club is being referred to; N0-S2 provides the contract detail that answers the question.
- No outside or additional storyline info was used.

<distractor>
<answer>They increased her base salary for the one-year extension.</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the outline explicitly says the club registered contract terms that reduce Maya Cortes's base salary and add incentives (N0-S2). This distractor is plausible because the extension was announced in an official press release and finalized with club staff present, which could suggest altered pay terms (N0-S0, N0-S1) and the player publicly discussing her role (N0-S8).</explanation>
<distractor-sentences>N0-S0,N0-S1,N0-S8</distractor-sentences>
</distractor>

<distractor>
<answer>They left her base salary unchanged and only added per-appearance fees on top of it.</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the outline states the club reduced her base salary as part of the registered terms and also included game-play incentives (N0-S2). It's plausible because the contract does include per-appearance fees and other game-related bonuses, which could be misread as additions to an unchanged base (N0-S3).</explanation>

</distractor>

<distractor>
<answer>They eliminated her base salary entirely and converted her compensation to 100% performance-based incentives.</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the document specifies a reduced base salary rather than eliminating it, along with incentives tied to minutes and appearances (N0-S2). This option seems believable because the outline details a variety of incentive mechanisms (per-appearance fees, stepped minutes bonuses) that could suggest heavy performance pay (N0-S3).</explanation>
<distractor-sentences>N0-S3,N0-S8</distractor-sentences>
</distractor>

<distractor>
<answer>They added a one-time signing bonus payable after she completed the club medical assessment.</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — there is no mention of any signing bonus in the outline; instead it records a reduced base salary plus game-play incentives (N0-S2). The distractor is plausible because the timeline notes a medical assessment and paperwork completed at the training facility, which could be conflated with a medical-triggered payment (N0-S5, N0-S1).</explanation>

</distractor>

<distractor>
<answer>They guaranteed her full-season salary regardless of minutes and appearances, removing any appearance-based payments.</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the outline clearly states the contract reduces her base salary and explicitly includes appearance- and minutes-linked incentives (N0-S2, N0-S3). It sounds credible because the club filed the finalized roster and secured her eligibility for the season, which might be misinterpreted as guaranteeing pay (N0-S6, N0-S7).</explanation>

I reviewed sentences from both events that include the bridge entity Maya Cortes. The goal is to pick one sentence from the first event and one from the second event that together form a good basis for a multi-hop question requiring linking facts about Maya Cortes.

Candidate sentences (from provided possible IDs):
- From event 1: N1-S0, N1-S2, N1-S4, N1-S5, N1-S6, N1-S8, N1-S9
- From event 2: N2-S0, N2-S2, N2-S4, N2-S6, N2-S8

I looked for pairs that:
- Span both events (require following guideline 1).
- Provide complementary, non-redundant facts about Maya Cortes that must be combined to answer a multi-hop question.
- Contain specific, event-unique information not present in the known-named-entities (the KB contains her bio and role but not these match-day actions).

Notable promising pairs:
- N1-S6 (team submitted a match-day availability notice naming Maya Cortes as eligible) + N2-S2 (medical staff withdrew Maya Cortes from the finalized roster after pre-match assessment). This pair creates an interesting sequence: she was named eligible then withdrawn the same day — a clear multi-hop that links administrative submission with subsequent medical withdrawal.
- N1-S0 (completed supervised full-contact training without setbacks) + N2-S0 (mild swelling recorded in pre-match assessment). That pair contrasts a cleared training session with later pre-match findings, also a good multi-hop timeline.
- N1-S5 (coach placed her on available-for-selection contingent on a minutes-management plan) + N2-S9 (re-evaluation scheduled to include a documented minutes-management recommendation). This links coaching minutes plan to the medical re-evaluation process.

I must return only one selection. I chose the pair N1-S6 and N2-S2 because they directly link an administrative nomination as eligible with an explicit later withdrawal — this yields a clear, challenging multi-hop question (who was named eligible then withdrawn) and spans both events as required. Both sentences explicitly include "Maya Cortes" and provide unique, event-specific facts not present in the KB.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N1-S6, N2-S2</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences together show a clear, event-spanning change in Maya Cortes's match availability: N1-S6 records that Rivermark Lynx submitted a match-day availability notice naming Maya Cortes as eligible for selection, and N2-S2 records that medical staff subsequently withdrew Maya Cortes from the finalized match-day roster after a pre-match assessment. Linking these facts creates a multi-hop question about who was initially listed as eligible and then withdrawn, requiring reasoning across both events and using event-unique information not present in the known entity biography.</explanation>

Sentence information:

- N2-S2: Rivermark Lynx medical staff withdrew Maya Cortes from the finalized match-day roster following the pre-match assessment on 2025-08-29. (Unique: medical staff withdrew her from the finalized match-day roster after a pre-match assessment on that date.)

Idea:
Ask what medical staff did to the individual who had been named as eligible in the club's match-day availability notice for the season opener. The answer should be a short action phrase drawn from N2-S2.

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences are required. The two selected sentences together provide (a) identification of the person as named eligible in the availability notice for the season opener (N1-S6) and (b) the specific action taken by medical staff regarding that same person (N2-S2).

Verification:
- The question paraphrases the bridge entity without using the name, using unique info from N1-S6 ("named as eligible for selection in the club's match-day availability notice for the season opener").
- The question asks for a specific action that can only be answered by using N2-S2 ("withdrew ... from the finalized match-day roster following the pre-match assessment").

Combined, they support multi-hop questions that require comparing coach and medical guidance or identifying the physician-specified cap in the context of the coach's plan; the numeric limits are unique details not present in the known-entities data, making cross-sentence reasoning necessary.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N1-S5: The Rivermark Lynx head coach said inclusion on the available-for-selection list is contingent on following a minutes-management plan that will initially limit Maya Cortes to a planned rotation of under 20 minutes.
- N3-S4: At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes.

Idea:
- Ask: "What initial conservative minutes cap did the player—identified as the one the head coach placed on the available-for-selection list contingent on a minutes-management plan limiting her to a planned rotation under 20 minutes—receive from Dr. Elias Verran?"
- Answer: "10–12 minutes"

Additional sentences:
- None required. The question uses the head coach's description (N1-S5) to identify the player and asks for the minutes cap provided by Dr. Verran (N3-S4). Both sentences are needed: N1-S5 identifies which player is being referenced without naming her; N3-S4 supplies the specific minutes cap.

Verification:
- The paraphrase does not mention the bridge entity by name and uses unique information from N1-S5 to identify her.
- The requested detail (initial conservative minutes cap) is explicitly given only in N3-S4.
- Both sentences are necessary to interpret and answer the question unambiguously.
- The answer is short, factual, and unique ("10–12 minutes").

<answer>15–18 minutes</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — Dr. Verran set a much tighter initial cap of 10–12 minutes. This range is plausible because the head coach specified an initial rotation "under 20 minutes," so a mid‑teens cap could be a believable alternative.</explanation>

</distractor>
<distractor>
<answer>10 minutes in a single stint</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the documented cap was 10–12 minutes total per match, to be delivered in no more than two separate stints, not a single 10‑minute appearance. Still plausible given emphasis on brief, managed appearances.</explanation>

<answer>Fully available with no minutes restriction</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the player’s inclusion was explicitly contingent on a minutes‑management plan and Dr. Verran imposed a conservative cap. This option is nonetheless believable because the coach did place her on the available‑for‑selection list and media coverage noted she was "ready to contribute."</explanation>

<answer>20–25 minutes</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — this exceeds the head coach’s stated "under 20 minutes" rotation and the medical clearance of 10–12 minutes. It may seem plausible if one misremembers the "under 20" guidance as a roughly 20‑plus minute allowance.</explanation>

</distractor>
<distractor>
<answer>5 minutes</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — Dr. Verran’s initial conservative cap was 10–12 minutes, so 5 minutes is too low. The choice is believable because the one‑week review includes a monitored five‑minute on‑court conditioning set used to judge load tolerance.</explanation>

I identified key facts in the two selected sentences: (1) the head coach's minutes-management plan limits Maya Cortes to a planned rotation under 20 minutes (N1-S5); (2) Dr. Elias Verran cleared her with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes (N3-S4). I then created questions nearly identical to the original but with a single small change that contradicts one of those sentences: (A) change "under 20 minutes" → "over 20 minutes" (contradicts N1-S5); (B) assert the initial cap was 15–18 minutes (contradicts N3-S4); (C) alter the doctor's last name to "Verrano" (contradicts N3-S4).

I need to produce questions that add one specific unverified detail to the original question. Use the two selected sentences as basis: coach placed player on available-for-selection contingent on minutes-management plan (initially under 20 minutes) and Dr. Verran cleared her with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes. The added detail must be possible, not confirmed by any sentence, and not contradicted.

Generate multiple questions based on different possible unverified specifics:
- method of communication (verbally in locker room) — not stated anywhere.
- scope limitation (only for away matches) — not stated anywhere.
- duration of enforcement (only for the first week / first two matches) — one-week review exists but does not confirm "only for the first week" or "only for first two matches", so those are unverified but possible; choose one to avoid overlap with scheduled one-week review. "Only for the first two matches" is a clear unverified detail.
Ensure each question remains similar to original and includes exactly one added specific detail.

Write brief explanation for each explaining why the added detail is unknown/unverified and cannot be confirmed from the provided sentences.

<explanation>The fact that the minutes cap was communicated verbally in the locker room is not stated or confirmed in any provided sentence; the sentences record the clearance and the cap but do not specify how or where Dr. Verran communicated it, so this detail is unknown and cannot be verified from the given information.</explanation>

I need to pick up to 1 tuple of 2 sentences (one from each event) that both include the bridge entity "Rivermark Lynx" and together support an interesting multi-hop question requiring reasoning across events.

Candidate sentences from Event 1 that include "Rivermark Lynx" (from provided possible IDs):
- N1-S0: completion of supervised full-contact training
- N1-S1: details of the training session (75 minutes, facility)
- N1-S2/N1-S3: post-session medical assessments reported no pain/normal function
- N1-S4: head coach placed Maya Cortes on available-for-selection list
- N1-S5: inclusion contingent on minutes-management plan limiting to under 20 minutes
- N1-S6/N1-S7: match-day availability notice submission and portal confirmation
- N1-S8/N1-S9: Maya Cortes media quotes

Candidate sentences from Event 2 that include "Rivermark Lynx" (allowed IDs):
- N3-S6: Dr. Elias Verran instructed the Rivermark Lynx medical team to perform daily symptom checks
- N3-S7: Dr. Verran asked the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist to record specific measures (pre/post pain, patellar girth, single-leg balance, analgesic use) and upload them
- N3-S8: Dr. Verran scheduled a one-week functional review and notified Rivermark Lynx coaching staff

Goals for a good pair:
- One sentence from each event (requirement 1).
- Both must explicitly include the bridge "Rivermark Lynx" (requirement 5).
- Combine to form a non-trivial multi-hop question: e.g., connect the club's selection/rostering decision with the specific clinical monitoring tasks requested by Dr. Verran.
- Ensure the facts are unique and not derivable from the known-named-entities metadata.

Evaluation:
- Pairing N1-S4 (coach placed Maya on available-for-selection list) with N3-S7 (Dr. Verran asked the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist to record specific measures and upload entries) meets requirements: both mention Rivermark Lynx; they come from different events; together they support a question that asks what roster decision the club made and which monitoring tasks were mandated — a multi-hop chain linking club selection decisions and the medical monitoring plan.
- Other possible pairs (e.g., N1-S5 with N3-S6 or N3-S8) are also plausible, but N1-S4 + N3-S7 gives a clear administrative/clinical link with specific, detailed monitoring parameters that are interesting to combine.

Conclusion: select the pair N1-S4 and N3-S7.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N1-S4, N3-S7</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both explicitly reference the bridge entity "Rivermark Lynx" and come from the two different events. N1-S4 records a team roster/selection decision by the Rivermark Lynx head coach (placing Maya Cortes on the available-for-selection list), while N3-S7 details the specific monitoring tasks Dr. Elias Verran asked the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist to record and upload (pre/post 0–10 pain scores, patellar girth, 30-second single-leg balance, and analgesic use). Together they enable a multi-hop question linking the club's selection decision to the detailed medical monitoring plan required by the club's clinicians.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N1-S4: The Rivermark Lynx head coach placed Maya Cortes on the available-for-selection list for the season opener after consulting with Rivermark Lynx medical staff. Unique details: (a) head coach action = placed Maya on available-for-selection list, (b) timing = for the season opener, (c) consultation with medical staff preceded placement. These specifics identify the team by that distinct action and context.
- N3-S7: Dr. Elias Verran asked the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist to record pre- and post-activity 0–10 pain scores, a brief patellar girth measure, a 30-second single-leg balance assessment, any analgesic use, and to upload these entries to the club medical portal within two hours of each check. Unique details: (a) list of measurements to record, (b) upload requirement = within two hours of each check, (c) instruction originates from Dr. Elias Verran to the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist.

Idea:
- Describe the team by the unique action from N1-S4 (the team whose head coach placed Maya Cortes on the available-for-selection list for the season opener after consulting medical staff). Ask for a specific short factual detail from N3-S7 tied to that team: the required upload deadline for the physiotherapist's recorded entries. The concise answer will be "within two hours" (or similar).

Additional sentences:
- None required. The description of the team comes from N1-S4 and the required upload deadline comes from N3-S7. Both selected sentences are referenced: the paraphrase identifies the bridge entity via N1-S4 and the factual detail requested is contained in N3-S7. Together they match the task requirement to combine both sentences.

Verification:
- Does the question avoid naming the bridge entity? Yes — it paraphrases the team by its uniquely described action in N1-S4.
- Does answering require information from both sentences? The question's phrasing ties the upload requirement to the team identified via N1-S4; the upload deadline itself is given only in N3-S7. The respondent must map the physiotherapist/upload instruction to the team described. Thus both sentences are used.
- Is the requested information concise and directly present in the selected sentences? Yes — "upload ... within two hours" is explicit in N3-S7.
- Is there any ambiguity or reliance on other sentences? No — all necessary facts are contained in the two selected sentences.

I need to pick up to one tuple of two sentences (one from each event) that both include the bridge entity "Rivermark Lynx" and together can support an interesting multi-hop question relying on the bridge.

Reviewing candidate sentences that include "Rivermark Lynx":

From 2025-08-29 event (N1):
- N1-S0: Maya Cortes completed supervised full-contact training observed by Rivermark Lynx staff.
- N1-S1: The full-contact session lasted ~75 minutes at the Rivermark Lynx training facility.
- N1-S2: Rivermark Lynx medical staff reported no acute pain or functional limitations.
- N1-S3: Post-session assessments by the Rivermark Lynx medical team recorded zero pain and normal function.
- N1-S4: Rivermark Lynx head coach placed Maya Cortes on the available-for-selection list.
- N1-S5: Coach noted inclusion is contingent on a minutes-management plan limiting her to under 20 minutes.
- N1-S6: Rivermark Lynx submitted a match-day availability notice to league administrators naming Maya Cortes eligible.
- N1-S7: The submission was via the league's official portal and received automated confirmation.
- N1-S8 / N1-S9: Quotes and media remarks including Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist—these also mention the club.

From 2025-09-05 event (N4):
- N4-S0: Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist Sofia Harlow uploaded daily monitoring entries for Maya Cortes.
- N4-S2: The monitoring entry recorded an increase in right-knee mid-patellar girth.
- N4-S6: Following monitoring entries, Rivermark Lynx withdrew Maya Cortes from on-court activities and arranged an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre.
- N4-S7: Rivermark Lynx submitted a formal non-availability notification at 09:35, secured an expedited ultrasound appointment for 14:30, and arranged for physiotherapist Sofia Harlow to accompany Maya Cortes using the club medical vehicle.
- N4-S8: Rivermark Lynx notified Dr. Elias Verran and scheduled an urgent clinical review; updated league portal with temporary 'medical' status and phoned the head coach.

Potential connections for multi-hop reasoning:
- N1-S6 (availability notice naming Maya Cortes eligible) establishes that Rivermark Lynx initially made her eligible for selection for the season opener.
- N4-S7 (formal non-availability notification, expedited ultrasound, physiotherapist accompaniment and club vehicle) shows Rivermark Lynx later withdrew her and organized urgent medical actions.
Combining these two supports an interesting multi-hop question about which organization both submitted an availability notice and later submitted a non-availability and arranged an expedited ultrasound — requiring linking across dates/events.

Uniqueness and compliance with guidelines:
- Both sentences explicitly name the organization "Rivermark Lynx" (satisfies requirement that all selected sentences include the bridge).
- The specific actions (submitting availability, later submitting non-availability and arranging ultrasound logistics) are event-specific details not present in the known-named-entities KB (which only gives organizational profile). Thus, the information needed to identify the bridge in the context of these actions is not obtainable from the KB alone.
- The pair spans both provided events, as required.

Therefore N1-S6 + N4-S7 form a suitable pair for generating a challenging multi-hop question (e.g., asking which organization took these two sequential administrative/medical actions concerning Maya Cortes).
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N1-S6, N4-S7</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both explicitly mention Rivermark Lynx and together trace a reversal in the club's administrative status for Maya Cortes: N1-S6 records that Rivermark Lynx submitted a match-day availability notice naming her eligible for selection, while N4-S7 shows Rivermark Lynx later submitted a formal non-availability notification and arranged an expedited same-day ultrasound and accompaniment. Linking these sentences requires multi-hop reasoning across the two events and uses organization-specific actions not available from the knowledge-base alone, making them well suited to form a challenging bridge-entity question.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N1-S6: "Rivermark Lynx submitted a match-day availability notice to league administrators naming Maya Cortes as eligible for selection for the season opener." Unique details: submitted a match-day availability notice to league administrators; named Maya Cortes as eligible for selection for the season opener.
- N4-S7: "Rivermark Lynx submitted a formal non-availability notification on the club management system at 09:35, secured an expedited ultrasound appointment at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre for 14:30 the same day, and arranged for physiotherapist Sofia Harlow to accompany Maya Cortes to the imaging using the club medical vehicle." Unique details: submitted a formal non-availability notification on the club management system at 09:35; secured ultrasound appointment at 14:30; arranged Sofia Harlow to accompany Maya using club medical vehicle.

Idea:
- Use the N1-S6 phrasing to identify the club without naming it, then ask for the exact time (from N4-S7) when that same club submitted the formal non-availability notification on the club management system. The answer should be the concise time "09:35".

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences required. The two selected sentences provide the identifier (N1-S6) and the time of the non-availability submission (N4-S7). Both are necessary: the identifier phrase comes from N1-S6 and the time comes from N4-S7.

Verification:
- Question paraphrases the bridge entity using unique info from N1-S6 and does not mention the bridge entity by name.
- The answer (09:35) is specifically stated in N4-S7.
- Both sentences are necessary: without N1-S6 the paraphrase would not identify which club, without N4-S7 the time is unknown.
- The question does not assume causality or other relations not present.
- The required information is unique to the selected sentences and cannot be inferred from other sentences.

I will generate several false-premise questions by changing a single detail from the selected sentences. The original asks when the Rivermark Lynx submitted the formal non-availability notification (N4-S7 gives 09:35). I will create subtle contradictions to N4-S7 only (so N1-S6 remains consistent), each with one false premise: change the time, change the submission system, change the staff member who accompanied. Keep questions otherwise similar to the original.

I must create questions that ask the same info (time of non-availability submission) but add one specific unverified detail each. Use only details that are possible given the context and not contradicted by any sentence. Selected sentences show Rivermark Lynx submitted availability and later submitted non-availability at 09:35; details about who submitted or the exact label/method are not specified. Generate multiple questions each adding one unverified detail: (1) submitted using physiotherapist Sofia Harlow's login (plausible since she made uploads earlier); (2) submitted from the club medical vehicle's mobile hotspot (plausible given vehicle use later); (3) submitted with the reason field set to "medical — suspected knee effusion" (plausible given swelling/effusion evidence but unverified); (4) submitted by the head of medical services (plausible; previous events show head of medical submitted withdrawals at other times but not this one).

I need to find up to one pair of sentences (from the provided single event) that both mention the bridge entity "Rivermark Lynx" and together can support a challenging multi-hop question requiring using the bridge entity to connect two facts.

Reviewing sentences:
- N1-S0: Maya completed supervised full-contact training observed by Rivermark Lynx staff.
- N1-S1: Training lasted ~75 minutes at Rivermark Lynx training facility in Harborfen with controlled scrimmage.
- N1-S2: Rivermark Lynx medical staff reported no acute pain or functional limitations for Maya.
- N1-S3: Post-session assessments by Rivermark Lynx medical team recorded zero pain on 0–10 scale, normal bilateral knee/ankle ROM, and satisfactory single-leg hop.
- N1-S4: Rivermark Lynx head coach placed Maya on available-for-selection list after consulting medical staff.
- N1-S5: Coach noted inclusion is contingent on a minutes-management plan initially limiting Maya to under 20 minutes while monitoring match response.
- N1-S6/N1-S7: Administrative submission of match-day availability notice through league portal with confirmation.
- N1-S8/N1-S9: Maya's media quotes about readiness and focus while adhering to minutes plan.

Potential multi-hop linkages:
- Medical assessment (N1-S3 or N1-S2) -> coach decision/minutes plan (N1-S4/N1-S5). This is a natural two-step reasoning: medical clearance findings by Rivermark Lynx medical team led to the coach's conditional selection/minutes management.
- Administrative submission (N1-S6/N1-S7) could link to selection (N1-S4), but that is more procedural and less interesting than connecting medical data to roster management.
- Training details (N1-S1) linked with medical results (N1-S3) could form a question about how the session influenced assessments, but pairing with coach's conditional plan makes a clearer multi-hop bridging entity use.

Guideline checks:
- Only one event present, so both sentences can come from same event (allowed).
- All candidate sentences include the bridge entity (Rivermark Lynx).
- The KB organization entry for Rivermark Lynx does not contain the specific medical findings (zero pain, ROM, single-leg hop) nor the precise minutes-management plan (under 20 minutes). So these sentences provide unique, necessary details for a multi-hop question.
- Choose the pair that best supports an interesting question: N1-S3 (detailed medical findings) + N1-S5 (coach's minutes-management contingency). This requires reasoning over both medical assessment and coaching decision, connected by the club (bridge entity).

Therefore select N1-S3 and N1-S5.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N1-S3, N1-S5</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both explicitly reference Rivermark Lynx and provide complementary, unique facts: N1-S3 gives detailed post-session medical assessment results (zero pain on a 0–10 scale, normal bilateral knee/ankle ROM, satisfactory single-leg hop), while N1-S5 records the coach's conditional roster decision (inclusion contingent on a minutes-management plan initially limiting Maya Cortes to under 20 minutes). Together they form a strong bridge-based multi-hop pair linking the club's medical clearance to the coach's minutes-management roster decision, enabling questions that require reasoning over both medical findings and coaching actions. The specific medical results and the exact minutes limit are not present in the known named-entities data, so both sentences are necessary.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N1-S3: Rivermark Lynx medical team recorded zero on a standard 0–10 pain scale; normal bilateral range-of-motion in knee and ankle; satisfactory single-leg hop performance during functional testing.
- N1-S5: Rivermark Lynx head coach noted inclusion on the available-for-selection list is contingent on following a minutes-management plan that will initially limit Maya Cortes to a planned rotation of under 20 minutes while monitoring match response.

Idea:
Ask for the specific post-session pain score recorded by the medical team, while identifying the club indirectly by referencing the head coach's statement about the minutes-management plan limiting Maya Cortes to under 20 minutes. The answer should be a concise numeric value.

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences are needed. The question uses the unique minutes-limit detail from N1-S5 to identify the club and asks for the pain-score detail uniquely found in N1-S3.

Verification:
- The question does not mention the bridge entity by name; it paraphrases using the head coach's minutes-management detail from N1-S5.
- The requested information (pain score) comes uniquely from N1-S3.
- Both sentences are required: the identification uses N1-S5, the answer comes from N1-S3.
- The answer is concise and unambiguous.

I will identify candidate sentence pairs (one from the 2025-08-29 event, one from the 2025-08-30 event) that both include the bridge entity "Maya Cortes" and together support a meaningful multi-hop question.

Possible first-event sentences with the bridge entity (from the allowed list):
- N2-S0: mild swelling in the right knee recorded during a pre-match physical assessment on 2025-08-29.
- N2-S2: Maya Cortes was withdrawn from the finalized match-day roster following the pre-match assessment on 2025-08-29.
- N2-S4: same-day diagnostic ultrasound imaging for Maya Cortes at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre on 2025-08-29.
- N2-S6: medical staff administered a single oral anti-inflammatory dose and applied an ice-compression protocol while awaiting ultrasound results on 2025-08-29.
- N2-S8: scheduled an overnight re-evaluation for Maya Cortes with Dr. Elias Verran at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to determine short-term availability.

Possible second-event sentences with the bridge entity:
- N3-S2: At 08:15 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran performed a repeat clinical examination and documented standardized knee range-of-motion and symptom scores for Maya Cortes.
- N3-S4: At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes.
- N3-S6: On 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran instructed the medical team to perform daily symptom checks before and after activity.
- N3-S8: Dr. Verran scheduled a one-week functional review at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to reassess load tolerance and notified coaching staff.

Considerations for multi-hop utility and uniqueness:
- A strong multi-hop should link an initial event (withdrawal, immediate treatment, or planned re-evaluation) to a consequential decision the next day (clinical exam, clearance with restrictions, or follow-up plan).
- N2-S2 (withdrawal from roster) pairs naturally with N3-S4 (cleared with a minutes cap) to form a clear temporal/causal chain: withdrawn before the match, re-assessed and cleared the next morning with restrictions. This supports questions requiring reasoning across the two days (e.g., "After being withdrawn from the roster, what restriction was applied when she was cleared?").
- Other potential pairs (e.g., N2-S6 treatment + N3-S4 clearance, or N2-S8 scheduled re-evaluation + N3-S4 clearance) also work, but N2-S2 -> N3-S4 gives a concise, compelling narrative: removal from match roster followed by conditional clearance.
- The sentences selected both explicitly name Maya Cortes and contain unique, specific facts (withdrawn from roster on 2025-08-29; cleared next morning with a 10–12 minute cap). These details are not fully redundant with the known-named-entities entry for Maya Cortes (which contains background/personal data but not these event-specific clinical/selection details).

Given the requirement to output up to 1 tuple, the pair N2-S2 (first event) and N3-S4 (second event) is chosen as the most suitable for generating a challenging multi-hop question that requires bridging the withdrawal and the subsequent conditional clearance.

Together they enable questions that require reasoning across the withdrawal event and the subsequent clearance/playing restriction.</explanation>

- N3-S4: At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes. Unique details: timestamp 08:35 on 2025-08-30; clearance for match selection by Dr. Elias Verran; initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes.

Idea:
- Ask: Using the identification "the player withdrawn from the finalized match-day roster after the pre-match assessment on 2025-08-29" (from N2-S2), what initial minutes cap did Dr. Elias Verran set when clearing that same player for match selection at 08:35 on 2025-08-30? The answer is a concise numeric range.

Additional sentences:
- None required. The identification detail comes from N2-S2 and the minutes-cap detail comes from N3-S4; both are present in the selected sentences.

Verification:
- The question does not name the bridge entity explicitly; it paraphrases using the unique detail (withdrawn from finalized match-day roster after pre-match assessment on 2025-08-29) from N2-S2.
- The answer (10–12 minutes) is contained uniquely in N3-S4.
- Both sentences are required: N2-S2 to identify which player is being referenced and N3-S4 to provide the minutes cap. The question cannot be answered using only one of the sentences.

- Goal: find up to 1 tuple of 2 sentences (one from the 2025-08-29 event and one from the 2025-09-05 event) that both include the bridge entity "Dr. Elias Verran" and together support a multi-hop question requiring reasoning across events.
- Candidate sentence IDs (must come from provided possible_sentence_ids): 
  - From 2025-08-29: N2-S8, N2-S9
  - From 2025-09-05: N4-S8, N4-S9
- Identify sentences that contain specific information about Dr. Elias Verran:
  - N2-S8: "Rivermark Lynx scheduled an overnight re-evaluation for Maya Cortes with Dr. Elias Verran at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to determine her short-term availability for selection."
    - Unique detail: an overnight re-evaluation was scheduled with Dr. Verran and purpose (determine short-term availability).
  - N2-S9: "The re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran was scheduled for 08:00 the following morning and was planned to include a repeat clinical examination, review of the ultrasound images, standardized knee range-of-motion measurements, and a documented minutes-management recommendation to be communicated to the Rivermark Lynx coaching staff after the assessment."
    - Unique details: specific time (08:00), planned components of the assessment, and that a minutes-management recommendation would be communicated to coaching staff.
  - N4-S8: "Rivermark Lynx notified Dr. Elias Verran and scheduled an urgent clinical review with Dr. Elias Verran to follow the focused ultrasound while Rivermark Lynx informed the head coach and league administrators of Maya Cortes' temporary non-availability for selection."
    - Unique detail: Dr. Verran was notified and an urgent clinical review was scheduled to follow the ultrasound as part of a temporary non-availability workflow.
  - N4-S9: "Dr. Elias Verran was alerted via encrypted email and an urgent phone call at 09:40 with the plan to perform a clinical review within two hours of the completed ultrasound, and the club also updated the league portal with a temporary 'medical' status and phoned the head coach to brief him on Maya Cortes' non-availability."
    - Unique details: specific alert methods (encrypted email and urgent phone call), exact alert time (09:40), and planned timeframe (within two hours of completed ultrasound).
- Evaluate combinations (must include one sentence from each event and all selected sentences must include the bridge entity):
  - Pairing N2-S9 (08:00 re-eval details) with N4-S9 (09:40 alert method/time and review timeframe) offers complementary, concrete facts: an originally scheduled 08:00 re-evaluation (event 1) and later operational notification details (event 2) — supports multi-hop reasoning about scheduling, timing, and notification of Dr. Verran across two events.
  - N2-S8 + N4-S9 is less precise than N2-S9 + N4-S9 because N2-S9 gives a concrete time and planned assessment components, making questions richer and more challenging.
  - N2-S9 + N4-S8 could work, but N4-S9 contains more specific, unique notification details (time and methods), which are better for multi-hop questions.
- Check guideline 6: the specific scheduling and notification details (08:00 re-evaluation time; 09:40 encrypted email and urgent phone call; plan to review within two hours of completed ultrasound) are not present in the known-named-entities entries and are unique to the selected sentences.
- Conclusion: select the pair N2-S9 (from 2025-08-29) and N4-S9 (from 2025-09-05). They span both events, both include the bridge entity, and together provide unique, complementary facts to form challenging multi-hop questions (e.g., asking about when Dr. Verran was scheduled to assess Maya and how/when he was alerted in the later episode).

<ids>N2-S9, N4-S9</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both name Dr. Elias Verran and come from different events (2025-08-29 and 2025-09-05). N2-S9 supplies a specific scheduled time (08:00) and the planned assessment components and reporting (repeat exam, ultrasound review, ROM measurements, minutes-management recommendation). N4-S9 provides distinct notification details (alerted via encrypted email and urgent phone call at 09:40) and an operational timeframe (clinical review within two hours of the completed ultrasound). Together they enable multi-hop questions that require linking Dr. Verran’s scheduled assessment responsibilities to how and when he was later notified—information not available in the known-named-entities data.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N2-S9: "The re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran was scheduled for 08:00 the following morning" and planned components: repeat clinical exam, review of ultrasound images, standardized knee ROM measurements, and a documented minutes-management recommendation to be communicated to the coaching staff after the assessment.
- N4-S9: "Dr. Elias Verran was alerted via encrypted email and an urgent phone call at 09:40" with plan to perform a clinical review within two hours of the completed ultrasound; the club updated the league portal with a temporary 'medical' status and phoned the head coach to brief him on Maya's non-availability.

Idea:
- Use the alert detail (09:40 encrypted email + urgent phone call) from N4-S9 to identify the clinician without naming him.
- Ask for the scheduled re-evaluation time (a specific short fact) from N2-S9.
- Question: "What time was the re-evaluation scheduled for the clinician who was alerted via encrypted email and an urgent phone call at 09:40?" Answer: "08:00 the following morning."

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences required. N4-S9 uniquely supplies the identification (alert at 09:40 via encrypted email and urgent phone call). N2-S9 supplies the scheduled re-evaluation time. Both selected sentences are necessary: identification comes from N4-S9 and the scheduled time from N2-S9.

Verification:
- Step 4 (don't mention name): The question paraphrases the bridge entity using the alert detail from N4-S9; it does not include the name.
- Step 5 (requires both sentences): The identity descriptor (alert at 09:40) is only in N4-S9; the scheduled time (08:00 the following morning) is only in N2-S9 — answering requires combining both.
- Step 6 (specificity/uniqueness): The alert timestamp and the scheduled time are concrete, specific details present in the selected sentences.
- Steps 7 & 8: No additional causal assumptions made; every detail in the question is directly supported by the selected sentences.

I need to produce questions that add a single specific unverified detail to the original question. Use only details that are possible given the context but not confirmed by any sentence, and ensure they are not contradicted. I will generate multiple questions based on different key aspects: sender of the alert (Sofia Harlow), an extra component of the re-evaluation (five-minute on-court conditioning test), and Dr. Verran's official role (team physician). Each question asks the same information (the scheduled time) while adding one unverified detail.

- Available sentence IDs that include the bridge entity: N2-S8, N2-S9 (both from the single provided event).
- Extracted content:
  - N2-S8: Scheduled an overnight re-evaluation for Maya Cortes with Dr. Elias Verran at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to determine short-term availability for selection.
  - N2-S9: Re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran scheduled for 08:00 the following morning; planned to include repeat clinical exam, review of ultrasound images, standardized knee range-of-motion measurements, and a documented minutes-management recommendation to be communicated to coaching staff.
- Check guideline constraints:
  - Both sentences include the bridge entity (Dr. Elias Verran) — satisfies rule 5.
  - Only one event present, so sentences may come from same event — allowed by rule 2.
  - Known named-entities do NOT include Dr. Elias Verran, so the specific scheduling, location, time, assessment components, and intended recommendation are unique to these sentences (satisfies rule 6 and 7).
- Potential multi-hop question types enabled by combining these sentences:
  - Temporal + outcome: "When was Dr. Elias Verran's re-evaluation scheduled and what recommendation was he expected to provide afterward?"
  - Location + procedure detail: "Where was Dr. Elias Verran scheduled to re-evaluate Maya Cortes and which assessments would he perform?"
  - Purpose + measurement: "What was the purpose of Dr. Elias Verran's re-evaluation and which standardized measurements were planned?"
- Conclusion: The pair N2-S8 and N2-S9 form a coherent bridge around Dr. Elias Verran, providing distinct but complementary facts (scheduling, location, time, assessment content, and expected recommendation) suitable for generating multi-hop questions requiring linking those details.

Sentence information:
- N2-S8: Rivermark Lynx scheduled an overnight re-evaluation for Maya Cortes with Dr. Elias Verran at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to determine her short-term availability for selection.
  - Unique details: an overnight re-evaluation was scheduled; it was with Dr. Elias Verran; location is Harborfen Diagnostic Centre; purpose is to determine short-term availability for selection.
- N2-S9: The re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran was scheduled for 08:00 the following morning and was planned to include a repeat clinical examination, review of the ultrasound images, standardized knee range-of-motion measurements, and a documented minutes-management recommendation to be communicated to the Rivermark Lynx coaching staff after the assessment.
  - Unique details: scheduled time is 08:00 the following morning; planned components of the assessment include repeat clinical exam, ultrasound review, standardized knee ROM measurements, and a documented minutes-management recommendation to be sent to coaching staff.

Idea:
Ask for the scheduled start time (specific short answer) of the overnight re-evaluation, while identifying the person by the fact that they were the doctor scheduled by Rivermark Lynx for an overnight re-evaluation at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to determine Maya Cortes's short-term availability. This description uses N2-S8; the time comes from N2-S9. Answer: "08:00 the following morning."

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences are required. Both N2-S8 (to uniquely identify the doctor/re-evaluation event and its purpose/location) and N2-S9 (to supply the exact scheduled time) are necessary and sufficient.

Verification:
- The question does not name the bridge entity; it paraphrases them as "the doctor scheduled by Rivermark Lynx for an overnight re-evaluation at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to determine Maya Cortes's short-term availability" — this paraphrase is directly supported by N2-S8.
- The requested specific detail (scheduled time) is present only in N2-S9.
- Answering requires combining identification from N2-S8 and time from N2-S9, so both sentences are needed.
- The answer is concise and unambiguous.

I need to produce multiple questions that add exactly one unverified, plausible detail to the original question so that the question becomes unanswerable from the provided sentences. Avoid details that are confirmed or explicitly refuted by the context. Best way to make the time unknown is to add a plausible rescheduling/delay scenario (overnight delay, emergency, pushed to afternoon) — these change the scheduled start time but are not mentioned anywhere and are not contradicted.

I need to pick up to one pair of sentences (two sentences) that both include the bridge entity Dr. Elias Verran and come from the two different events. The possible sentence IDs that include the bridge entity are N3-S0, N3-S1, N3-S2, N3-S3, N3-S4, N3-S6, N3-S7, N3-S8 (event dated 2025-08-30) and N4-S8, N4-S9 (event dated 2025-09-05). Per the instructions, the tuple must cover both events (one sentence from the first event, one from the second event).

I want a pair that yields an interesting multi-hop question requiring reasoning across both sentences (not trivial repetition) and that provides unique, sentence-level details about Dr. Elias Verran’s actions not present in the KB. Several candidate connections:
- N3-S7 (Dr. Verran instructing the physiotherapist to record/upload monitoring measures) combined with N4-S1 or N4-S7 (physiotherapist uploaded entries / accompanied to imaging) — this links an instruction to its follow-through, but N4-S1 doesn't include Dr. Verran, so it fails requirement 5 (both sentences must include the bridge). N4-S8/N4-S9 do include Dr. Verran.
- N3-S8 (Dr. Verran scheduled a one-week functional review at Harborfen and notified coaching staff) paired with N4-S9 (Dr. Verran was alerted via encrypted email and urgent phone call at 09:40 with plan to perform clinical review within two hours of the completed ultrasound). This pair:
  - Comes from both events.
  - Both sentences explicitly mention Dr. Elias Verran.
  - They provide distinct actions/timeline points (scheduling a planned one-week review vs being urgently alerted and scheduled for an immediate post-ultrasound review), enabling a multi-hop question about who both scheduled the one-week review and was alerted for the urgent same-day review.
  - The specific timing and actions in N4-S9 (alerted at 09:40, plan to perform clinical review within two hours) are not in the KB and are not given elsewhere in the events except in N4-S9 itself, so the necessary identifying info for the bridge comes from these sentences.

I verify that the selected sentence IDs are allowed (they appear in the provided possible_sentence_ids list), that one is from the first event (N3-S8) and the other from the second event (N4-S9), and that both include the bridge entity. This pair will support a clear multi-hop question that requires combining the planned one-week review action with the later urgent alert/action.

- N4-S9: Dr. Elias Verran was alerted via encrypted email and an urgent phone call at 09:40 with the plan to perform a clinical review within two hours of the completed ultrasound, and the club also updated the league portal with a temporary 'medical' status and phoned the head coach to brief him on Maya Cortes' non-availability.
  Unique specifics: alerted via encrypted email and urgent phone call at 09:40; plan to perform a clinical review within two hours of the completed ultrasound; club updated league portal to temporary 'medical' status; head coach phoned about non-availability.

Idea:
Ask for the specific time the clinician was alerted (from N4-S9) while identifying that clinician by referencing the unique scheduling action they took on 2025-08-30 (from N3-S8). This requires combining both sentences: the identificatory description comes from N3-S8 and the time comes from N4-S9. The answer is a concise time value.

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences required. The two selected sentences provide the unique identifying detail (the clinician who scheduled the one-week functional review at Harborfen on 2025-08-30) and the alert time (09:40). Both are necessary to link identity to the time.

Verification:
- Question does not mention the bridge entity by name; it paraphrases using the unique scheduling detail from N3-S8.
- The requested fact (alert time) is only in N4-S9.
- Both sentences must be used: N3-S8 to identify which person is meant; N4-S9 to supply the time.
- The information is specific and yields a single concise answer ("09:40").

I will create several questions that keep the original structure (asking the alert time) but introduce one subtle false premise each time. I must ensure each false premise contradicts only one of the two selected sentences (N3-S8 or N4-S9) and is not answerable from the wider context. I will vary the changed element across name, location, date (contradicting N3-S8), and email encryption (contradicting N4-S9).

I need to pick up to 1 tuple of 2 sentences (one from the first event, one from the second event) that both mention the bridge entity Maya Cortes and together can form a challenging multi-hop question.

First-event candidate sentences containing Maya Cortes (from possible IDs):
- N3-S2: Dr. Elias Verran performed repeat clinical exam and documented standardized knee ROM and symptom scores for Maya Cortes.
- N3-S4: Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes.
- N3-S6: Dr. Elias Verran instructed the Rivermark Lynx medical team to perform daily symptom checks for Maya Cortes before and after training and match activity.
- N3-S8: Dr. Elias Verran scheduled a one-week functional review at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to reassess load tolerance for Maya Cortes.

Second-event candidate sentences (from possible IDs):
- N4-S0: Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist Sofia Harlow uploaded daily monitoring entries for Maya Cortes.
- N4-S2: Uploaded monitoring entry recorded an overnight increase in right-knee mid-patellar girth of +0.8 cm for Maya Cortes.
- N4-S3: Description of how mid-patellar girth was measured for Maya Cortes.
- N4-S4 / N4-S5: Pre-activity pain score of 3/10 and one 400 mg ibuprofen taken the previous evening (timing details).
- N4-S6: Following monitoring entries, Rivermark Lynx withdrew Maya Cortes from all on-court team activities and arranged expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound.
- N4-S7: Club submitted non-availability notification and arranged expedited ultrasound appointment and transport for Maya Cortes.
- N4-S8 / N4-S9: Notifications to Dr. Verran and scheduling of urgent clinical review and alerts to coaching/league.

I want a pair that makes an interesting multi-hop question: e.g., linking an earlier clearance/plan to a later change in status prompted by monitoring findings. For a good bridge, one sentence should state an initial plan (unique detail) and the other should state a subsequent objective finding or action (unique detail) that contradicts or changes the plan. This forces reasoning across the timeline.

N3-S4 (cleared with a 10–12 minute cap) is a concise, specific plan that is only present in the first event. N4-S2 (girth increase +0.8 cm) is an objective change recorded later and is unique to the second event; alternatively N4-S6 (withdrawal and expedited ultrasound) is the management action that follows the monitoring. Pairing N3-S4 with N4-S2 allows a question that asks how monitoring findings related to the prior clearance (e.g., what measurement changed despite being cleared). Pairing N3-S4 with N4-S6 allows a question about how her availability changed after being cleared.

I need to ensure the selected sentences contain unique information not inferable from known named-entities. Known entities list contains Maya’s identity and profession but not clinical details like minutes cap, girth increase, pain score, withdrawal, or ultrasound scheduling. So these clinical details are unique to the event sentences.

Between the two choices, N3-S4 + N4-S6 yields a clear multi-hop: initial clearance with constrained minutes cap (N3-S4) → subsequent withdrawal from all on-court activity and expedited ultrasound (N4-S6). This combination supports a challenging question asking how the player's selection status changed across the two events and why (the why could be linked to other sentences, but N4-S6 itself references "following the monitoring entries" giving causal link). Alternatively, N3-S4 + N4-S2 is narrower (specific measurement). Either is valid; I will choose the pair that most directly contrasts initial clearance with later withdrawal: N3-S4 and N4-S6.

These two sentences both explicitly include the bridge entity Maya Cortes, are from different events, and contain unique, complementary information suitable for multi-hop reasoning (timeline/change in management).

<ids>[N3-S4, N4-S6]</ids>
<explanation>Sentence N3-S4 states that Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes for match selection with a specific conservative minutes cap (10–12 minutes) — a distinct initial management plan. Sentence N4-S6, from the later event, records that following monitoring entries Rivermark Lynx withdrew Maya Cortes from all on-court team activities and arranged an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound — a clear subsequent change in availability/management. Together these two sentences (from different events) form a strong bridge for multi-hop questions that require reasoning across the timeline (e.g., asking how her match availability changed between the clearance and the later monitoring-driven decision), and they contain unique clinical details not present in the known named-entities.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N3-S4: At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes. (Unique details: exact timestamp 08:35 on 2025-08-30; clearance for match selection; minutes cap 10–12 minutes; named clinician Dr. Elias Verran.)
- N4-S6: Following the monitoring entries, Rivermark Lynx withdrew Maya Cortes from all on-court team activities and arranged an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre. (Unique details: withdrawal from all on-court team activities following monitoring entries; arranged expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound; imaging location Harborfen Diagnostic Centre.)

Idea:
Ask for the location of the expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound (specific short answer) while referring to the individual by the unique clearance detail from N3-S4 (cleared at 08:35 on 2025-08-30 with a 10–12 minute cap). This forces use of both sentences: the paraphrase identifies the person via N3-S4, and the requested detail comes from N4-S6.

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences required. The selected sentences provide the unique identifying paraphrase (N3-S4) and the answerable detail (N4-S6).

Verification:
- The question does not name the bridge entity; it paraphrases using the unique clearance timestamp and minutes cap from N3-S4.
- The answer (location) is contained in N4-S6 and cannot be deduced from N3-S4 alone.
- Both sentences are necessary: the paraphrase identifier from N3-S4 and the ultrasound location from N4-S6.
- The answer is concise and unambiguous: "Harborfen Diagnostic Centre".

I have three candidate sentences (N3-S0, N3-S8, N3-S9), all of which mention the bridge entity Harborfen Diagnostic Centre.

1) Identify sentences that contain specific information about the bridge entity:
- N3-S0: states that Harborfen Diagnostic Centre supplied the focused musculoskeletal ultrasound images reviewed by Dr. Elias Verran (unique detail: supplier of the images).
- N3-S8: states that Dr. Verran scheduled a one-week functional review at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre (unique detail: scheduling the review at that centre).
- N3-S9: gives the booked date/time (09:00 on 2025-09-06) at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre and outlines what the review will include (repeat targeted ultrasound, isokinetic strength testing, monitored conditioning set) — very specific procedural details tied to the centre.

2) Look for connections to form multi-hop questions:
- Combining N3-S0 with N3-S9 links the centre as both the provider of the original imaging and the site/time/protocol for the follow-up functional review — good bridge for a multi-hop Q that requires connecting the diagnostic supplier to the scheduled reassessment details.
- N3-S8 is less informative than N3-S9 (N3-S9 contains the booking specifics and test details), so pairing N3-S0 with N3-S9 yields a richer, more challenging multi-hop Q.

3) Evaluate uniqueness vs known named entities:
- The known-named-entities entry for Harborfen Diagnostic Centre provides general clinic description (outpatient imaging clinic, mission, size). It does not state that it supplied the specific focused ultrasound images for Maya Cortes, nor that it has a booked one-week functional review at 09:00 on 2025-09-06 including the listed tests. Thus the two selected sentences together provide unique, non-redundant facts about the centre that are not in the knowledge base.

4) Decide best pair:
- Choose N3-S0 and N3-S9. They both include the bridge entity, and together enable multi-hop questions linking who supplied the initial images to where/when and what the follow-up review will involve.

This meets all guidelines: only uses IDs from the provided possible_sentence_ids, both include the bridge entity, and supplies unique information for generating multi-hop questions.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N3-S0, N3-S9</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both name Harborfen Diagnostic Centre and together provide complementary, specific facts: N3-S0 identifies the centre as the supplier of the focused musculoskeletal ultrasound images Dr. Verran reviewed, and N3-S9 gives the booked date/time and the detailed components of the one-week functional review to be performed at the same centre. This pairing supports multi-hop questions that require linking the initial diagnostic imaging source to the follow-up assessment location, timing, and procedures — information not available in the general known-entity entry.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N3-S0: At 08:00 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran reviewed the focused musculoskeletal ultrasound images supplied by Harborfen Diagnostic Centre. (Unique details: exact time and date of review; that the images were supplied by the diagnostic centre; the images were focused musculoskeletal ultrasound.)
- N3-S9: The one-week functional review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre and will include repeat targeted ultrasound, standardized isokinetic quadriceps/hamstring strength testing and a monitored five-minute on-court conditioning set to determine criteria for incremental minutes increases. (Unique details: booking time/date 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at the diagnostic centre; the planned components of the one-week functional review.)

Idea:
Ask for the specific time (from N3-S0) when Dr. Elias Verran reviewed the ultrasound images, while referring to the diagnostic centre by its unique booking detail from N3-S9 (so the question requires linking the review event to the same diagnostic centre that booked the 09:00 one-week review). The answer should be a concise timestamp: "08:00 on 2025-08-30".

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences required. The two selected sentences together provide the necessary and unique information: N3-S9 uniquely identifies the diagnostic centre by its 09:00 on 2025-09-06 booking, and N3-S0 provides the exact review time.

Verification:
- Does question paraphrase the bridge entity without naming it? Yes — refers to "the diagnostic centre that booked a one-week functional review for 09:00 on 2025-09-06".
- Is the required answer present only when combining both sentences? Yes — identifying which diagnostic centre is being referenced relies on N3-S9; the review time comes from N3-S0. Both are needed to ground the reference.
- Is the answer concise and factual? Yes — gives exact time and date.
- Is there any ambiguity or alternative valid answer? No — only one time is given in N3-S0.
- No extra unstated assumptions are made.

I identified key facts in the two selected sentences: N3-S0 states Dr. Verran reviewed the images at 08:00 on 2025-08-30; N3-S9 states the one-week review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06. I created four questions that keep the original structure but introduce a single false premise each: two that alter the booked review time/date (contradicting N3-S9) and two that alter the date of Dr. Verran's image review (contradicting N3-S0). Each false premise is subtle and mutually exclusive with the identified sentence only.

I need to produce unknown-premise questions by adding one specific unverified detail to the original question. Use selected sentences N3-S0 (review time) and N3-S9 (one-week review booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at Harborfen). Added detail must be possible but not confirmed or contradicted by any sentences. Create multiple questions based on different key info. Keep each question similar to original and add only one unverified detail. Provide concise explanations stating why the added detail is unknown.
Potential unverified details considered: "during a video call with the Harborfen sonographer" (not mentioned anywhere), "in his clinic at the Rivermark Lynx training facility" (location of review not specified), "with Maya Cortes present during the review" (presence at review not specified), "images accessed via encrypted email" (transmission method not specified).

I need to pick up to 1 tuple (2 sentences) from the allowed sentence IDs (N3-S2, N3-S4, N3-S6, N3-S8). All chosen sentences must contain the bridge entity "Maya Cortes" (they do). Since only one event is provided, both sentences may come from the same event.

Goal: find a pair that yields an interesting multi-hop question requiring reasoning across both sentences with Maya as the bridge.

Review of candidate sentences:
- N3-S2: At 08:15 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran performed a repeat clinical examination and documented standardized knee range-of-motion and symptom scores for Maya Cortes.
  - Contains time (08:15), exam action and documentation specific to Maya.
- N3-S4: At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes.
  - Contains time (08:35), clearance decision, and the specific minutes cap value (10–12 minutes).

- N3-S6: On 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran instructed the Rivermark Lynx medical team to perform daily symptom checks for Maya Cortes.
  - Contains an instruction for ongoing monitoring — useful but less directly linked to an immediate outcome.
- N3-S8: On 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran scheduled a one-week functional review at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to reassess load tolerance for Maya Cortes.
  - Contains scheduling for follow-up assessment and location — also useful.

Potential multi-hop connections:
- N3-S2 -> N3-S4: sequence where a repeat clinical exam was documented (N3-S2) and shortly afterwards the player was cleared with a specific minutes cap (N3-S4). A multi-hop question could ask about the clearance outcome (minutes cap) given the prior exam documentation — requires linking the examination event to the clearance decision via the bridge entity.
- N3-S4 -> N3-S8: clearance decision and scheduling of a follow-up review — could ask where/when follow-up was scheduled after clearance. However the exact appointment time is in N3-S9 which is not allowed, so N3-S8 only gives location and plan.
- N3-S2 -> N3-S8 or N3-S6 -> N3-S8 etc. are possible but less directly linked than the exam -> clearance pair.

Check guideline about unique information: The minutes cap and the times/decisions in these sentences are not present in the known-named-entities KB, so the pair provides unique facts required to answer multi-hop questions (e.g., "After Dr. Verran's repeat clinical exam of Maya Cortes, what conservative minutes cap was set when she was cleared for match selection?").

Select the most direct and interesting pair: N3-S2 and N3-S4 (exam then clearance). This supports a multi-hop question that requires linking the documented exam to the subsequent clearance decision and the specific minutes cap.

Sentence information:
- N3-S2: At 08:15 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran performed a repeat clinical examination and documented standardized knee range-of-motion and symptom scores for Maya Cortes. (Unique details: exact time 08:15 on 2025-08-30; he documented standardized knee range-of-motion and symptom scores.)
- N3-S4: At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes. (Unique details: exact time 08:35 on 2025-08-30; clearance for match selection; initial conservative minutes cap = 10–12 minutes.)

Idea:
- Describe the person using the unique detail from N3-S2 (the repeat clinical exam at 08:15 and documentation of standardized knee range-of-motion and symptom scores) and ask for the specific minutes cap assigned in N3-S4. The answer is a concise numeric range: "10–12 minutes."

Additional sentences:
- None required. The two selected sentences provide the necessary, unique timestamps and the minutes cap. The question relies only on information from N3-S2 (to identify the individual without naming them) and N3-S4 (to supply the minutes cap).

Verification:
- The question paraphrases the bridge entity using unique info from N3-S2 and asks for a specific detail only given in N3-S4.
- The answer can only be determined by combining both sentences (identification via N3-S2 and assigned cap via N3-S4).
- The phrasing avoids naming the bridge entity and does not assume any causal relation beyond identity.
- The answer is concise and unambiguous.

I reviewed the event sentences that include the bridge entity "ibuprofen" (allowed IDs: N4-S4, N4-S5). Both sentences reference the same medication but provide complementary, specific details:
- N4-S4 states that the monitoring entry "recorded a pre-activity pain score of 3/10 and documented one 400 mg ibuprofen taken the previous evening." This links dosage with the presence of a pain score.
- N4-S5 adds timing and context: it notes Maya Cortes "self-reported taking the single 400 mg ibuprofen dose at approximately 21:30 the previous evening" and that the 3/10 pain score was recorded at 08:50 immediately prior to the morning session.

Connections for multi-hop reasoning:
- Bridge entity: ibuprofen. One sentence supplies dosage and association with pain, the other supplies the precise reported time of ingestion and the exact time the pain score was recorded.
- A multi-hop question can require combining dosage and ingestion time with the pain-score/timing relationship (e.g., asking what dose was taken and when relative to the recorded pre-activity pain).

Uniqueness check:
- The timing and dose details are not present elsewhere in the event text or in the known named-entities (the product entry lists ibuprofen generically but not dose or patient-reported time). Thus both sentences are needed to answer detailed questions about dose and timing.

Conclusion: The pair [N4-S4, N4-S5] yields a concise, interesting multi-hop question involving the bridge entity (ibuprofen) that requires integrating dose, reported ingestion time, and the time the pain score was recorded.

<explanation>These two sentences both mention ibuprofen and provide complementary, specific details — N4-S4 records a 400 mg ibuprofen dose linked to a pre-activity 3/10 pain score, while N4-S5 specifies the self-reported ingestion time (~21:30) and the exact time the 3/10 pain score was recorded (08:50). Together they enable multi-hop questions that require combining dose, ingestion timing, and pain-assessment timing; the needed details are not available elsewhere or in the named-entity product entry.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N4-S4: The uploaded monitoring entry recorded a pre-activity pain score of 3/10 and documented one 400 mg ibuprofen taken the previous evening.
- N4-S5: The entry noted Maya Cortes self-reported taking the single 400 mg ibuprofen dose at approximately 21:30 the previous evening and that the pre-activity 3/10 pain score was recorded at 08:50 immediately prior to the scheduled morning session.

Idea:
Ask for the pre-activity pain score (specific short value) associated with the single 400 mg dose that was self-reported as taken at ~21:30 the previous evening. This requires linking the dose timing/detail (from N4-S5) to the recorded pre-activity pain score/time (from N4-S4 and N4-S5).

Additional sentences:
- None. The two selected sentences contain all unique details needed: the dose amount and time (N4-S5) and the pre-activity pain score and its recording time (N4-S4/N4-S5).

Verification:
- The question paraphrases the bridge entity as "the single 400 mg dose she reported taking at about 21:30 the previous evening" (does not name ibuprofen explicitly).
- The answer (3/10) is uniquely supported by the selected sentences.
- Both sentences are required: N4-S5 supplies the timing and single-dose detail for the paraphrase; N4-S4/N4-S5 supply the pain score value and its recording time.

- N0-S2 & N0-S3: contract terms — N0-S2 states reduced base salary + incentives; N0-S3 details the incentive structure. Together they allow stories about financial/roster strategy and player motivations.
- N0-S4 & N0-S5: medical clearance and details of assessment — important to address fitness after injury and justify inclusion on roster.
- N0-S7: league confirmation of registration — closes the procedural loop and confirms eligibility for opening fixtures.
- N0-S9: player quote — humanizes the story and ties to incentives/fitness.

Avoided: N0-S1 (redundant procedural detail about press release and paperwork), N0-S6 (similar to N0-S7 but less explicit), N0-S8 (redundant with N0-S9).

This subset allows a reporter to write: lead on extension, explain pay/incentives, note injury history and clearance, confirm eligibility, and include the player's commitment quote. It's balanced for both sports and business desks.

Plan: Write a concise sports news piece dated 2025-08-29. Paragraph 1: Lead with signing of one-year extension, note it's final roster move before domestic transfer deadline, mention roster submitted that afternoon and league confirmation making Cortes eligible. Paragraph 2: Detail contract terms — reduced base salary and gameplay incentives tied to minutes and appearances; enumerate incentive structure: per-appearance fees, stepped bonuses for minutes thresholds in individual games, incremental payments tied to appearing in target proportion of regular-season fixtures. Paragraph 3: Cover medical assessment and monitored return-to-play program after last season's injury layoff; list assessment components (strength/conditioning benchmarks, on-court movement and shooting tests, cardiovascular screening), short monitoring period, club medical staff cleared her to progress into full-team contact training; include club-released quote from Maya Cortes exactly as provided.

I reviewed all N1 sentences. Key angles: (A) medical/fitness update (cleared in full-contact session, objective test results); (B) team selection/availability (coach placing her on available list and submitting match-day notice); (C) minutes-management and player quote showing readiness but cautious approach.

I wanted a subset that tells a coherent story: Cortes completed full-contact training and passed objective tests -> coach has made her available but with a managed minutes plan -> club submitted availability to league -> player expressed readiness. This combination supports a match-preview/fitness-update story for newspapers.

I avoided redundancy (omitted both submission and automated receipt separately, chose the confirmation sentence N1-S7 as the formal administrative closure) and skipped longer description of the session length and location to keep the subset tighter and more news-focused.

Rivermark Lynx's Maya Cortes Cleared for Season Opener After Clean Full-Contact Session

<article>
<paragraph>
<text>On 2025-08-29 veteran point guard Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session without setbacks, Rivermark Lynx medical and coaching staff reported. Post-session assessments by the club's medical team recorded a zero on the standard 0–10 pain scale, normal bilateral range-of-motion in both the knee and ankle, and satisfactory single-leg hop performance during functional testing, clearing Cortes from a clinical standpoint for selection decisions ahead of the season opener.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Following consultation with medical staff, Rivermark Lynx head coach placed Cortes on the available-for-selection list for the season opener, while stipulating that her inclusion is contingent on a minutes-management plan. The plan will initially limit Cortes to a planned rotation of under 20 minutes as coaching and medical staff monitor her match response. The club submitted the match-day availability notice through the league's official portal and received an automated confirmation receipt from league administrators confirming the submission.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>After the session Cortes, a driven and disciplined veteran known for leadership and mentoring younger players, told assembled media, "I'm ready to contribute under the minutes plan the Rivermark Lynx sets."

- Make only one minimal grammatical edit: add a comma after "After the session" in paragraph three to improve readability.
- Confirm all factual statements in the article match the ground truth: supervised full-contact session without setbacks; post-session assessments (0/10 pain, normal bilateral knee/ankle ROM, satisfactory single-leg hop); head coach placed Maya Cortes on available-for-selection after consulting medical staff; inclusion contingent on minutes-management plan limiting initial rotation to under 20 minutes; club submitted match-day availability via league portal and received automated confirmation; Maya's quoted remark to assembled media.
- Do not alter the headline text (kept as original).
Changes justified:
- The single punctuation change is purely grammatical and does not alter facts or tone. No factual statements were added, removed, or rephrased beyond this minor edit because the article already matched the ground truth information.

I reviewed the current-event sentences. Key elements to build a news story: the clinical finding (swelling and measurement), immediate team action (withdrawal from roster and notification), diagnostic follow-up (same-day ultrasound with specifics), acute treatment on site (anti-inflammatory and cold-compression) and planned re-evaluation/next steps (overnight review with named doctor and planned minutes-management recommendation).

I avoided redundant or purely administrative confirmations (e.g., the more general S4 when S5 gives appointment time and imaging detail; S6 is a general version of S7 so I kept S7 which is more specific). The chosen sentences together allow a concise, coherent report focusing on the injury assessment, impact on match availability, diagnostics, treatment, and next steps.

Rivermark Lynx Withdraw Veteran Point Guard Maya Cortes After Pre‑Match Knee Assessment

<paragraph>
<text>Rivermark Lynx medical staff withdrew veteran point guard Maya Cortes from the finalized match-day roster on 2025-08-29 after a pre-match physical assessment detected mild swelling in her right knee. The club physiotherapist recorded a mid-patellar girth difference of approximately 1.4 cm comparing the right knee to the left and noted a small suprapatellar fluid wave on bedside palpation at about 17:10 local time; the head of medical services informed the head coach and submitted the formal withdrawal through the league match-day change portal at 17:25, with arena match officials informed shortly thereafter.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Following the assessment, the Harborfen Diagnostic Centre appointment was booked for 18:00 with an imaging request specifying a focused musculoskeletal ultrasound of the patellofemoral region including longitudinal and transverse views and Doppler assessment to evaluate for effusion or tendon pathology. On-site treatment included 400 mg of ibuprofen administered orally by the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist and application of a pneumatic cold-compression cuff set to approximately 6°C in 20-minute cycles, while pre- and post-treatment pain scores were recorded on a 0–10 scale.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>A re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran is scheduled for 08:00 the following morning and will include a repeat clinical examination, review of the ultrasound images, standardized knee range-of-motion measurements, and a documented minutes-management recommendation to be communicated to the Rivermark Lynx coaching staff after the assessment.

- Verify each factual statement against ground-truth event info.
- Identify one potentially unverifiable claim: the phrase "the club’s emphasis on careful player management" is not explicitly stated in the ground-truth; the organization ground-truth does state a mission about sustainable operations and regional talent development.
- Remove the unverifiable phrasing "the club’s emphasis on careful player management" and replace it with a factual reference to the Lynx's stated mission from the ground truth.
- Keep all time stamps, treatments, measurements, and planned re-evaluation details unchanged because they are supported by the ground-truth.
- Maintain overall flow and minimal edits to preserve original style.

Changes made and justification:
- Replaced the clause "will be assessed with the club’s emphasis on careful player management consistent with the Lynx’s focus on sustainable operations and regional talent development." with "will be assessed; the Lynx's stated mission emphasizes sustainable operations and regional talent development." 
  Justification: The specific phrase "emphasis on careful player management" is not in the provided ground-truth. The organization's mission referencing sustainable operations and regional talent development is in the ground-truth, so I attribute the club's broader mission while removing the unverifiable claim about "careful player management."

I need to pick one subset of sentences from the current event (N3-S0..N3-S9) that forms a coherent news story, focusing on a distinct aspect. Possible angles: diagnostic findings, medical clearance and match availability with minutes limit, ongoing monitoring protocol, or planned follow-up testing.

For a single versatile news snippet, the medical-clearance-with-conditions angle is strong: it shows the imaging result, clinical exam findings, the decision to clear for selection with a conservative minutes cap, specifics of that cap, the day-to-day monitoring required, and the planned one-week functional review criteria. This provides context (what was found), the decision (cleared but limited), how it will be managed (daily checks and specific metrics), and the follow-up plan (objective tests to determine escalation). That should be self-contained and useful for match previews, medical updates, or features on load management.

Selected sentences:
- N3-S1 (ultrasound finding: small effusion, intact tendons) — explains the pathology and rules out tendon tear/tendinopathy.
- N3-S3 (clinical exam: ROM, pain scores, stability) — gives functional status and mild symptoms.
- N3-S4 (cleared for match selection with 10–12 minute cap) — main news decision.
- N3-S5 (definition of minutes cap and coaching instructions) — how the cap will be applied in practice.
- N3-S7 (specific daily monitoring tasks to be recorded) — shows active management and data collection.
- N3-S9 (one-week functional review details and tests) — explains criteria for increasing minutes and follow-up timing.

This combination avoids repetition, covers diagnosis, decision, management, and follow-up, and is suitable for a news brief or match preview.

Maya Cortes Cleared for Limited Return After Knee Scan; 10–12 Minute Cap Set by Team Doctor
</headline>
<article>
<paragraph>
<text>At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran cleared Rivermark Lynx point guard Maya Cortes for match selection with a conservative initial minutes cap of 10–12 minutes. The cap was defined as total in-game time per match for the immediate fixtures, to be delivered in no more than two separate stints, with coaching specifically instructed to minimise prolonged high-intensity defensive minutes during each appearance.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>On targeted imaging Dr. Verran recorded a small anechoic suprapatellar effusion measuring approximately 7–9 mm in depth, noted intact patellar and quadriceps tendon continuity, and observed no focal Doppler hyperemia to suggest active tendinopathy. Clinical assessment documented active knee extension of 0° and flexion to 135° bilaterally, a resting visual analogue pain score of 1/10 rising to 2/10 with single-leg squat provocation, and stable anterior drawer and Lachman tests with no joint-line tenderness.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Dr. Verran has asked the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist to record a pre- and post-activity 0–10 pain score, a brief patellar girth measure, a 30-second single-leg balance assessment, and any analgesic use, and to upload these entries to the club medical portal within two hours of each check. A one-week functional review is booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre and will include repeat targeted ultrasound, standardized isokinetic quadriceps/hamstring strength testing and a monitored five-minute on-court conditioning set to determine criteria for incremental minutes increases.</text>

Plan:
- Keep the original article's style, tone, and sentence structure.
- Verify each factual statement against the ground-truth event information; all paragraphs are supported by the ground truth.
- Make only minimal copyediting changes for clarity and tense consistency: add a comma after the introductory phrase "On targeted imaging," and change "has asked" to "asked" to match past-tense narration used elsewhere in the article.
- Justification of changes:
  1. Comma after "On targeted imaging" — grammatical improvement for readability; no change in meaning and still faithful to ground truth.
  2. Change "has asked" to "asked" — aligns verb tense with the rest of the report (past tense) and with the ground-truth phrasing; factual content unchanged.
- No factual content added, removed, or hedged; all statements are verifiable from the provided ground truth.

Goal: produce one subset that gives a clear, newsworthy narrative: monitoring entry showed worsening swelling/pain, medication, then club withdrew player and arranged expedited imaging, notified team doctor and league. Must include who uploaded entry and accompaniment detail for color.

Candidates:
- N4-S0 (physio uploaded) establishes source/actor.
- N4-S2 (mid-patellar girth +0.8 cm) is the key objective finding.
- N4-S4/N4-S5 (pain score and ibuprofen) — choose N4-S4 as concise; N4-S5 repeats timing detail, so omit.
- N4-S6 (withdrawn and ultrasound arranged) critical action.
- N4-S7 (formal notification, appointment time, physiotherapist to accompany) adds logistics and color.
- N4-S8 (Dr Verran notified and league informed) shows escalation and official communication.
- N4-S9 (alert via encrypted email and portal update plus phone to coach) gives further procedural detail — slightly overlaps with N4-S8 but adds specifics of methods; include because it's newsy.

Avoid N4-S1 (timestamp/protocol) — redundant given N4-S0. Final subset: N4-S0, N4-S2, N4-S4, N4-S6, N4-S7, N4-S8, N4-S9. This tells a coherent story: physiotherapist logged worsening swelling and pain (and ibuprofen), club withdrew her and fast-tracked ultrasound, arranged logistics and informed club doctor, coach and league via formal channels.

- Include monitoring findings (right-knee mid-patellar girth +0.8 cm, pre-activity pain 3/10, one 400 mg ibuprofen previous evening).
- Describe immediate actions: same-day expedited focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre, withdrawal from on-court activities.
- Cover administrative timeline and logistics: non-availability notification at 09:35, ultrasound appointment 14:30, physiotherapist accompanying in club medical vehicle.
- Note communications: Dr. Elias Verran alerted (encrypted email and urgent phone call at 09:40), urgent clinical review to follow ultrasound within two hours of completion, league portal updated to 'medical' status, head coach and league administrators briefed.

- Verify each factual statement against the ground truth: all key facts in the three paragraphs are supported.
- Make two small readability edits (add a missing comma after the date; replace a semicolon with a comma) and explain/justify them.
- Do not introduce any new facts or remove any verified facts.
- Keep headline unchanged as instructed.

Changes made and justification:
1) Added a comma after the opening date ("On 2025-09-05, ...") to improve readability and match standard journalistic punctuation. This does not alter any factual content.
2) Replaced a semicolon in the first paragraph with a comma to improve sentence flow between related clauses; content remains identical and verifiable against the ground truth.

No factual statements were removed or altered substantively because all assertions in the original paragraphs are consistent with the provided ground truth.

<passage>The club registered contract terms that reduce {Maya Cortes's|PERSON-1} base salary and include game-play incentives tied to minutes and appearances for the one-year extension. A medical assessment — administered over a short monitoring period — consisted of strength and conditioning benchmarks, on-court movement and shooting tests and cardiovascular screening; the club medical staff cleared {Cortes|PERSON-1} to progress into full-team contact training.</passage>

Goal: provide one versatile subset that supports a coherent news story emphasizing Maya Cortes's return-to-play, medical clearance, coach decision/minutes management, official eligibility and player comments. This lets a reporter write about fitness, squad status and how she'll be used.

Choose sentences that:
- Establish she completed full-contact training without setbacks (N1-S0).
- Give detail about the session to convey realism (N1-S1).
- Provide objective medical metrics showing clearance (N1-S3).
- Show coach's decision to make her available (N1-S4).
- Explain the minutes-management plan limiting her to under 20 minutes (N1-S5).
- Confirm the club notified league administrators that she's eligible (N1-S6).
- Include a player quote about readiness and role (N1-S9) — more descriptive than the short quote in N1-S8.

Avoid redundancy: skip N1-S2 (overlaps with N1-S3), skip N1-S7 (automated receipt duplicates N1-S6), skip N1-S8 (shorter quote) to keep narrative clean.

Final selection: N1-S0, N1-S1, N1-S3, N1-S4, N1-S5, N1-S6, N1-S9.

Maya Cortes Cleared for Season Opener After Successful Full-Contact Session with Rivermark Lynx
</headline>
<article>
<paragraph>
<text>On 2025-08-29 veteran point guard Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session without setbacks at the Rivermark Lynx training facility in Harborfen, a session observed by the club’s medical and coaching staff. The workout lasted approximately 75 minutes and featured controlled live scrimmage periods designed to replicate match contact situations as part of her return-to-play progression.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Post-session assessments by the Rivermark Lynx medical team recorded zero on a standard 0–10 pain scale, normal bilateral range-of-motion in the knee and ankle, and satisfactory single-leg hop performance during functional testing. After consulting with medical staff, the Rivermark Lynx head coach placed Cortes on the available-for-selection list for the season opener, with inclusion contingent on a minutes-management plan that will initially limit her to under 20 minutes while the team monitors her match response; the club has submitted a match-day availability notice to league administrators naming Cortes as eligible for selection.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Smiling and accompanied by the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist outside the main court, Cortes said she will concentrate on defensive intensity and on-court leadership while adhering to the team’s minutes plan. The club — a mid-sized professional organization based in Harborfen focused on regional talent development — will monitor her integration closely as the season begins.</text>

Plan:
- Keep the original article's tone and sentence structure; make only minimal edits to ensure all facts are strictly supported by the ground truth.
- Identify unverifiable phrase(s): "as part of her return-to-play progression" is not present in the ground truth and introduces an extra characterization. Remove it.
- Slightly reword the final sentence to explicitly tie monitoring to the minutes-management plan already mentioned (this reflects head coach/medical monitoring stated in the ground truth) and avoid adding new claims about the club's plans beyond the provided information.
- Maintain all other factual statements since they match the ground truth.

Changes and justification:
1. Removed "as part of her return-to-play progression" from paragraph 1.
   - Justification: The ground truth does not explicitly state this phrasing. Although implied, it is not provided as a fact and therefore should be removed to avoid introducing unverified information.

2. Adjusted the final sentence in paragraph 3 to say the club "will monitor her match response under that plan as the season begins," tying monitoring explicitly to the minutes-management plan.
   - Justification: The ground truth indicates the head coach said inclusion is contingent on a minutes-management plan and that the team will monitor her match response. Rewording links the monitoring to that plan and avoids introducing broader claims about the club's actions beyond the provided details.

No other factual changes were necessary; remaining content aligns with the ground truth.

The club physiotherapist recorded a mid-patellar girth difference of approximately 1.4 cm compared with the left knee and noted a small suprapatellar fluid wave on bedside palpation at about 17:10 local time. The Rivermark Lynx head of medical services informed the head coach and submitted the formal withdrawal through the league match-day change portal at 17:25, with arena match officials notified shortly thereafter—steps consistent with the club’s established approach to player welfare and match-day procedures.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Immediate on-site care included 400 mg of ibuprofen administered orally by the physiotherapist and application of a pneumatic cold-compression cuff set to approximately 6°C in 20-minute cycles; pre- and post-treatment pain scores were recorded on a 0–10 scale.

Goal: create one distinct subset that yields a coherent, newsworthy short story about Maya Cortes' medical reassessment and conditional clearance for selection.

Key points to include for context and clarity:
- Dr. Verran reviewed the ultrasound images (timeline/authority) — N3-S0.
- Ultrasound finding: small suprapatellar effusion, intact tendons, no active tendinopathy — N3-S1.
- Clinical exam results: ROM, low pain scores, provocation details — N3-S3.
- Clearance for match selection with conservative minutes cap (main news hook) — N3-S4.
- Details about the minutes cap and restrictions for coaching (practical implications) — N3-S5.
- Daily monitoring instructions to the club medical team (ongoing management) — N3-S6.
- Specific monitoring measures requested (pain score, girth, balance, analgesic use, upload requirement) — N3-S7.
- Planned one-week functional review and what it will include (follow-up timeline and criteria) — N3-S8 and N3-S9.

Avoided redundancy: All selected sentences add unique detail — imaging, exam, clearance, immediate playing limits, monitoring protocol, and scheduled reassessment — forming a full short news piece explaining why she is available but restricted and how the club will manage her.

Rivermark Lynx’s Maya Cortes Cleared for Limited Match Duty After Ultrasound; Daily Monitoring and One-Week Review Scheduled
</headline>
<article>
<paragraph>
<text>Rivermark Lynx point guard Maya Cortes has been cleared for match selection after assessment by consultant sports medicine physician Dr. Elias Verran on 2025-08-30, with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes per match. The cap, issued at 08:35 on 2025-08-30, is defined as total in-game time for the immediate fixtures, to be delivered in no more than two separate stints, and coaching has been instructed to minimise prolonged high‑intensity defensive minutes during each appearance.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Dr. Verran reviewed focused musculoskeletal ultrasound images supplied by Harborfen Diagnostic Centre at 08:00 on 2025-08-30 and recorded a small anechoic suprapatellar effusion measuring approximately 7–9 mm in depth, with intact patellar and quadriceps tendon continuity and no focal Doppler hyperemia to suggest active tendinopathy. Clinical examination documented active knee extension of 0° and flexion to 135° bilaterally, a resting visual analogue pain score of 1/10 that rose to 2/10 with single‑leg squat provocation, and stable anterior drawer and Lachman tests with no joint‑line tenderness.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>On 2025-08-30 Dr. Verran instructed the Rivermark Lynx medical team to perform daily symptom checks for Cortes before and after training and match activity. He asked the club physiotherapist to record a pre‑ and post‑activity 0–10 pain score, a brief patellar girth measure, a 30‑second single‑leg balance assessment and any analgesic use, and to upload these entries to the club medical portal within two hours of each check. Dr. Verran also scheduled a one‑week functional review at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre, notifying Rivermark Lynx coaching staff; that review is booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 and will include repeat targeted ultrasound, standardized isokinetic quadriceps/hamstring strength testing and a monitored five‑minute on‑court conditioning set to determine criteria for any incremental minutes increases.</text>

Plan:
- Keep original headline unchanged as instructed.
- Maintain article's original tone and sentence structure while ensuring every detail from the ground-truth outline is present.
- Ensure chronological times (08:00 review, 08:35 clearance) are included and clearly associated with the actions.
- Confirm ultrasound findings (small anechoic suprapatellar effusion 7–9 mm, intact patellar and quadriceps tendon continuity, no focal Doppler hyperemia) are stated.
- Confirm clinical exam details (active knee extension 0°, flexion 135° bilaterally, resting VAS 1/10 rising to 2/10 with single-leg squat, stable anterior drawer and Lachman, no joint-line tenderness).
- Ensure minutes cap details: 10–12 minutes per match, total in-game time for immediate fixtures, delivered in no more than two stints, with coaching instruction to minimise prolonged high-intensity defensive minutes.
- Include instructions for daily symptom checks before and after training/match activity and specifics to be recorded by physiotherapist (pre/post 0–10 pain score, brief patellar girth, 30‑second single-leg balance, any analgesic use) and requirement to upload entries to club medical portal within two hours.
- Confirm scheduling of one-week functional review: booked 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre, includes repeat targeted ultrasound, standardized isokinetic quadriceps/hamstring strength testing, and a monitored five-minute on-court conditioning set to determine criteria for incremental minutes increases.

Rivermark Lynx’s Maya Cortes Cleared for Limited Match Duty After Ultrasound; Daily Monitoring and One-Week Review Scheduled
</headline>
<article>
<paragraph>
<text>Rivermark Lynx point guard Maya Cortes was cleared for match selection after assessment by consultant sports medicine physician Dr. Elias Verran on 2025-08-30, with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes per match. The cap — issued at 08:35 on 2025-08-30 — is defined as total in‑game time for the immediate fixtures, to be delivered in no more than two separate stints, and coaching has been instructed to minimise prolonged high‑intensity defensive minutes during each appearance.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Dr. Verran reviewed focused musculoskeletal ultrasound images supplied by Harborfen Diagnostic Centre at 08:00 on 2025-08-30 and recorded a small anechoic suprapatellar effusion measuring approximately 7–9 mm in depth, with intact patellar and quadriceps tendon continuity and no focal Doppler hyperemia to suggest active tendinopathy. His clinical examination documented active knee extension of 0° and flexion to 135° bilaterally, a resting visual analogue pain score of 1/10 that rose to 2/10 with single‑leg squat provocation, and stable anterior drawer and Lachman tests with no joint‑line tenderness.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Also on 2025-08-30, Dr. Verran instructed the Rivermark Lynx medical team to perform daily symptom checks for Cortes before and after training and match activity.

Goal: produce one coherent subset capturing the key developments: daily monitoring triggered by physiotherapist, objective measurements (swelling), symptom report (pain/ibuprofen), formal withdrawal and expedited imaging, and escalation to club doctor/league. This gives a compact narrative suitable for a sports/news brief about a temporary injury setback and administrative steps.

Selected sentences:
- N4-S0 establishes who uploaded the entry (physiotherapist Sofia Harlow) and date.
- N4-S1 shows the upload was official, time-stamped and visible to medical staff (adds credibility/timeliness).
- N4-S2 provides the objective finding (mid-patellar girth +0.8 cm) — newsworthy medical detail.
- N4-S4 gives symptom context (pre-activity pain 3/10 and ibuprofen taken).
- N4-S7 describes the club's operational response: formal non-availability at 09:35, expedited ultrasound appointment at 14:30, and physiotherapist accompaniment.
- N4-S8 documents escalation to Dr. Elias Verran and notification of coach and league — completes the chain of decision-making.

Omissions and reasoning:
- N4-S3 (measurement protocol) omitted to avoid technical redundancy; N4-S5 duplicates ibuprofen timing found in N4-S4.
- N4-S6 (withdrawn from on-court activities and arranged expedited ultrasound) overlaps with N4-S7 which is more detailed.
- N4-S9 (alerts via encrypted email/phone and league portal update) overlaps with N4-S8 and adds minor procedural detail; omitted to keep subset concise.

This subset supports a concise news story about a monitored increase in knee swelling/pain that led the Lynx to withdraw Maya Cortes from activity and seek expedited imaging and medical review while informing league and coaching staff.

- Report the clinical findings from the entry: overnight increase in right-knee mid-patellar girth +0.8 cm, pre-activity pain score 3/10, one 400 mg ibuprofen taken previous evening.

Plan:
- Compare each sentence in the article paragraphs against the ground-truth event_info.
- Determine whether any factual statements are unverifiable or incorrect.
- Make only minimal edits. If all statements are supported by the ground truth, keep wording largely unchanged to preserve the original news style.
- Provide a brief justification for the (lack of) changes.

Findings:
- Every factual element in both paragraphs (date, time of upload 09:12, uploader Sofia Harlow, use of the club's standardized daily-monitoring template, time-stamp visibility to head of medical services and physiotherapy team, +0.8 cm mid-patellar girth, pre-activity pain score 3/10, one 400 mg ibuprofen taken the previous evening, formal non-availability notification at 09:35, expedited ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre for 14:30, physiotherapist to accompany using club medical vehicle, notification of Dr. Elias Verran, urgent clinical review to follow the ultrasound, and informing head coach and league administrators) is directly supported by the provided ground truth.
- No statements introduce information beyond the ground truth, nor are there unverifiable claims.
- Therefore no factual corrections were necessary. I retained the original wording and structure to preserve the article's style, making no substantive edits.

Changes made:
- None (content retained as originally written). This preserves the article's original style and ensures all statements remain accurate to the ground truth.

Goal is one subset that tells a complete, newsworthy story without redundancy: it should state the signing, summarize the notable contract terms (reduced base + incentives), note that she has been medically cleared to return to full contact training, confirm the club registered her and the league confirmed eligibility, and include a direct player quote to add color.

Including the club's match-day submission (N1-S6) shows administrative confirmation of eligibility.

I avoided N1-S2 because N1-S3 already gives the medical findings in more detail. I omitted the automated confirmation receipt (N1-S7) as it's minor and redundant with N1-S6. I also omitted the shorter quote (N1-S8) because N1-S9 is more descriptive.

Maya Cortes Cleared for Season Opener After Successful Full‑Contact Session

<article>
<paragraph>
<text>On 2025-08-29 Rivermark Lynx point guard Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session without setbacks, team medical and coaching staff confirmed. The session took place at the Rivermark Lynx training facility in Harborfen, lasted approximately 75 minutes and included controlled live scrimmage periods designed to replicate match contact situations; the work was observed throughout by the club’s medical and coaching personnel.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Post-session assessments by the Rivermark Lynx medical team recorded zero on a standard 0–10 pain scale, normal bilateral range-of-motion in both knee and ankle, and satisfactory single-leg hop performance during functional testing. After consulting with medical staff the head coach placed Cortes on the available-for-selection list for the season opener, while noting that inclusion is contingent on a minutes-management plan that will initially limit her to a planned rotation of under 20 minutes as the team monitors her match response. The club has submitted a match-day availability notice to league administrators naming Cortes as eligible for selection.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Speaking to reporters outside the main court, smiling and accompanied by the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist, Cortes said she plans to focus on defensive intensity and on-court leadership while adhering to the Lynx’s minutes plan as she returns to competition.</text>

Plan:
- Make only minimal edits to the three article paragraphs to ensure strict fidelity to the ground truth and improve clarity/grammar.
- Specifically: add a comma after the date for readability; correct the phrasing "both knee and ankle" to "the knee and ankle" to match the ground-truth wording and fix grammar; leave other factual content unchanged since it matches the ground truth.
- Document and justify each change in this scratchpad.

Justification of changes:
1) Added a comma after "On 2025-08-29" in paragraph 1 to improve sentence flow and readability. This is a stylistic/grammatical change only and does not alter facts.
2) Changed "both knee and ankle" to "the knee and ankle" in paragraph 2 to mirror the ground-truth phrasing ("normal bilateral range-of-motion in the knee and ankle") and correct awkward grammar. This preserves the factual claim (normal bilateral ROM) while improving clarity.

No other factual content was altered because the original paragraphs were consistent with the provided event information.

Maya Cortes Cleared for Season Opener After Successful Full‑Contact Session
</headline>
<article>
<paragraph>
<text>On 2025-08-29, Rivermark Lynx point guard Maya Cortes completed a supervised full-contact training session without setbacks, team medical and coaching staff confirmed. The session took place at the Rivermark Lynx training facility in Harborfen, lasted approximately 75 minutes and included controlled live scrimmage periods designed to replicate match contact situations; the work was observed throughout by the club’s medical and coaching personnel.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Post-session assessments by the Rivermark Lynx medical team recorded zero on a standard 0–10 pain scale, normal bilateral range-of-motion in the knee and ankle, and satisfactory single-leg hop performance during functional testing. After consulting with medical staff, the head coach placed Cortes on the available-for-selection list for the season opener, while noting that inclusion is contingent on a minutes-management plan that will initially limit her to a planned rotation of under 20 minutes as the team monitors her match response. The club has submitted a match-day availability notice to league administrators naming Cortes as eligible for selection.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Speaking to reporters outside the main court, smiling and accompanied by the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist, Cortes said she plans to focus on defensive intensity and on-court leadership while adhering to the Lynx’s minutes plan as she returns to competition.</text>

Plan:
- Keep the original article's concise, factual tone and structure.
- Verify each ground-truth sentence is represented:
  1) Supervised full-contact session on 2025-08-29 observed by Rivermark Lynx medical and coaching staff — include date and observers.
  2) Session lasted ~75 minutes at Rivermark Lynx training facility in Harborfen and included controlled live scrimmage periods replicating match contact — include location, duration, and scrimmage detail.
  3) Post-session assessments: 0 on 0–10 pain scale, normal bilateral knee and ankle ROM, satisfactory single-leg hop performance during functional testing — include all metrics and tests.
  4) Head coach placed Cortes on available-for-selection list after consulting medical staff — include consultation and list placement for season opener.
  5) Inclusion contingent on minutes-management plan limiting her initially to under 20 minutes while monitoring match response — include exact contingency and planned rotation under 20 minutes.
  6) Club submitted match-day availability notice to league administrators naming Cortes eligible for selection for the season opener — include submission and naming.
  7) Cortes spoke to reporters outside the main court, smiling and accompanied by the physiotherapist, and said she plans to focus on defensive intensity and on-court leadership while adhering to the minutes plan — include setting, demeanor, physiotherapist, and quote/intent.
- Make only minimal edits to paragraph text to ensure all details are explicitly stated and flow coherently.

I need to create one subset of sentence IDs from the current event that forms a coherent, newsworthy story about Maya Cortes being withdrawn before a match due to knee swelling. Key elements to include: the medical finding (mild swelling), specific measurement/details to add credibility (mid-patellar girth difference, suprapatellar fluid wave), the immediate consequence (withdrawal from match-day roster and formal notification), diagnostics arranged (same-day ultrasound with specifics), acute treatment administered (ibuprofen + cold-compression with details — choose one of the two similar items to avoid redundancy), and the planned follow-up (overnight re-evaluation with Dr. Elias Verran and what that will cover, including minutes-management recommendation). 

Avoid redundancy: N2-S6 (general note about anti-inflammatory + ice) overlaps with the more specific N2-S7 (400 mg ibuprofen and pneumatic cuff), so include only N2-S7. Include N2-S5 for ultrasound technical detail. Include N2-S3 for procedural notification. Include N2-S8 and N2-S9 for follow-up. That yields a nine-sentence subset (all except N2-S6), which provides context, specifics, team actions, and next steps — suitable for a range of news angles (injury update, team selection impact, medical response).

Rivermark Lynx Withdraws Veteran Point Guard Maya Cortes After Right‑Knee Swelling in Pre‑Match Assessment
</headline>
<article>
<paragraph>
<text>Rivermark Lynx medical staff recorded mild swelling in the right knee of veteran point guard Maya Cortes during a pre‑match physical assessment on 2025-08-29 and withdrew her from the finalized match‑day roster the same day. The club physiotherapist measured an approximate mid‑patellar girth difference of 1.4 cm when comparing the right knee to the left and noted a small suprapatellar fluid wave on bedside palpation at about 17:10 local time. The Rivermark Lynx head of medical services informed the head coach and submitted the formal withdrawal through the league match‑day change portal at 17:25, with arena match officials informed shortly thereafter.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Medical staff scheduled same‑day diagnostic ultrasound imaging for Cortes at the Harborfen Diagnostic Centre on 2025-08-29, booking the appointment for 18:00 with a request for a focused musculoskeletal ultrasound of the patellofemoral region including longitudinal and transverse views and Doppler assessment to evaluate for effusion or tendon pathology. Before imaging, the physiotherapist administered 400 mg of ibuprofen orally and applied a pneumatic cold‑compression cuff set to approximately 6°C in 20‑minute cycles, recording pre‑ and post‑treatment pain scores on a 0–10 scale as part of the on‑site management.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Rivermark Lynx have scheduled an overnight re‑evaluation for Cortes with Dr. Elias Verran at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to determine her short‑term availability for selection; the re‑evaluation is set for 08:00 the following morning and will include a repeat clinical examination, review of the ultrasound images, standardized knee range‑of‑motion measurements and a documented minutes‑management recommendation to be communicated to the Rivermark Lynx coaching staff after the assessment. Cortes, a disciplined team leader and mentor as well as the club’s starting point guard, will remain under the club’s medical oversight while the diagnostic and follow‑up pathway is completed; the Rivermark Lynx, a mid‑sized professional club headquartered in Harborfen, has indicated it will follow the medical advice when determining selection and minutes.</text>

Plan:
- Keep headline unchanged.
- Review each paragraph against ground truth and make only necessary edits.
- Paragraph 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly; keep them with minimal punctuation/flow adjustments if needed.
- Paragraph 3 contains two unverifiable/unsupported claims: (a) that Cortes is the club’s "starting point guard" — ground truth lists her as a "point guard" but does not say she is the starter; (b) that the club "has indicated it will follow the medical advice when determining selection and minutes" — ground truth does not state the club made such an indication. Remove these specific claims.
- Replace the removed claims with wording supported by the ground truth: note Cortes' disciplined/team-leader attributes (from person data) and state she will undergo the diagnostic and follow-up pathway. Retain the factual sentence that the minutes-management recommendation will be communicated to coaching staff, as this is in the ground truth.
- Make minimal stylistic adjustments to maintain original article tone and flow.

Changes and justification:
1) Removed "starting" before "point guard" — not specified in ground truth.
2) Removed the sentence claiming the club "has indicated it will follow the medical advice when determining selection and minutes" — not present in ground truth.
3) Added a concise, supported statement that Cortes is "a disciplined team leader and mentor" (consistent with ground-truth description) and that she "will undergo the diagnostic and follow-up pathway" — this aligns with the scheduled re-evaluation and diagnostic plan in the ground truth.
4) Kept all other clinical and timeline details unchanged since they are directly supported by the ground truth.

I need to pick one subset of sentence IDs from the current event (N3-S0 to N3-S9) that forms a coherent, newsworthy story and offers a useful angle for a newspaper. Possible angles: medical findings, immediate clearance and game-time restriction, monitoring plan, and follow-up review. A single subset should include enough context without redundancy.

Key sentences:
- N3-S1: ultrasound result — small effusion, intact tendons, no Doppler hyperemia. Important for explaining injury severity.
- N3-S3: clinical exam — ROM, low pain scores, provocation pain; supports the decision to clear.
- N3-S4: clearance with minutes cap — the central news hook.
- N3-S5: defines the minutes cap specifics — explains how it will be applied.
- N3-S6 and N3-S7: daily monitoring instructions and specific metrics to be recorded — important for player management and club accountability.
- N3-S8/N3-S9: scheduled one-week functional review — gives timeline and criteria for possible escalation.

To avoid redundancy and keep the subset focused, I will omit the timestamp lines (N3-S0 and N3-S2) since they are less necessary for a general news story. I will include N3-S9 rather than N3-S8 because N3-S9 contains the detailed components of the one-week review (tests and conditioning set), which is more informative.

Final chosen IDs: N3-S1, N3-S3, N3-S4, N3-S5, N3-S6, N3-S7, N3-S9 — this combination tells the full arc: diagnostic findings, clinical status, conditional clearance with strict minutes cap and how it will be managed and reviewed.

- Explain the minutes-cap definition and coaching instructions (no more than two stints, minimise prolonged high-intensity defensive minutes).
- Detail daily monitoring instructions for Rivermark Lynx medical team and specific physiotherapist measurements and upload requirement.
- State the one-week functional review appointment at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre on 2025-09-06 at 09:00 and list the planned tests and purpose.

<text>At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 consultant sports medicine physician Dr. Elias Verran cleared Rivermark Lynx point guard Maya Cortes for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes following targeted imaging and clinical assessment. Dr. Verran recorded a small anechoic suprapatellar effusion on the images measuring approximately 7–9 mm in depth, noted intact patellar and quadriceps tendon continuity, and observed no focal Doppler hyperemia suggestive of active tendinopathy. On clinical testing he documented active knee extension of 0° and flexion to 135° bilaterally, a resting visual analogue pain score of 1/10 rising to 2/10 with single-leg squat provocation, and stable anterior drawer and Lachman tests with no joint-line tenderness.</text>
</paragraph>

<text>The minutes cap was defined as total in-game time per match for the immediate fixtures, to be delivered in no more than two separate stints and with coaching instructed to minimise prolonged high-intensity defensive minutes during each appearance. On 2025-08-30 Dr. Verran instructed the Rivermark Lynx medical team to perform daily symptom checks for Maya Cortes before and after training and match activity, and asked the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist to record a pre- and post-activity 0–10 pain score, a brief patellar girth measure, a 30-second single-leg balance assessment, and any analgesic use, and to upload these entries to the club medical portal within two hours of each check.</text>

<passage>At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 consultant sports medicine physician {Dr. Elias Verran|PERSON-2} cleared {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} point guard {Maya Cortes|PERSON-1} for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes following targeted imaging and clinical assessment. On ultrasound {he|PERSON-2} recorded a small anechoic suprapatellar effusion measuring approximately 7–9 mm in depth, noted continuity of the patellar and quadriceps tendons, and observed no focal Doppler hyperemia to suggest active tendinopathy. On clinical testing {Dr. Verran|PERSON-2} documented active knee extension of 0° and flexion to 135° bilaterally, a resting visual analogue pain score of 1/10 rising to 2/10 with single-leg squat provocation, and stable anterior drawer and Lachman tests with no joint-line tenderness.</passage>
<passage>The minutes cap was defined as total in-game time per match for the immediate fixtures, to be delivered in no more than two separate stints, with coaching instructed to minimise prolonged high-intensity defensive minutes during each appearance. On 2025-08-30 {Dr. Verran|PERSON-2} also instructed the {Rivermark Lynx|ORGANIZATION-1} medical team to perform daily symptom checks for {Cortes|PERSON-1} before and after training and match activity, and asked the club physiotherapist to record a pre- and post-activity 0–10 pain score, a brief patellar girth measure, a 30‑second single-leg balance assessment and any analgesic use — with those entries to be uploaded to the club medical portal within two hours of each check.</passage>
<passage>A one-week functional review has been booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at {Harborfen Diagnostic Centre|ORGANIZATION-2} and will include repeat targeted ultrasound, standardized isokinetic quadriceps/hamstring strength testing and a monitored five-minute on-court conditioning set to determine criteria for incremental increases to {her|PERSON-1} permitted minutes.</passage>

Goal: produce one distinct subset that provides a coherent, newsworthy narrative suitable for a newspaper. The current event details a medical monitoring entry leading to withdrawal and expedited imaging/clinical review. Key elements to include:
- Who recorded/uploaded the entry and that it was through the club portal (establishes official nature) — choose N4-S1 (time-stamped secure portal).
- Objective finding of increased swelling (most newsworthy medical detail) — N4-S2.
- Measurement method adds credibility and avoids ambiguity — N4-S3.
- Symptom/medication context (pain score and ibuprofen) — N4-S4 (concise).
- Immediate actions taken: withdrawal from activities and expedited ultrasound — N4-S6.
- Formal non-availability submission and appointment logistics (time, physio transport) — N4-S7.
- Notification and plan for urgent clinical review with Dr. Verran and informing head coach/league — N4-S8.

Avoid redundancy: omit N4-S0 (similar to S1 but less specific), omit N4-S5 (duplicate medication timing), omit N4-S9 (repeats notification details and encryption; S8 covers notification and clinical review scheduling).

This selection yields a clear timeline: official monitoring upload → objective swelling and pain → withdrawal and expedited imaging → formal non-availability and clinical review scheduled. Suitable for a news article focused on player medical update and club/league protocols.

Maya Cortes Withdrawn by Rivermark Lynx After Right‑Knee Swelling; Same‑Day Ultrasound Booked
</headline>
<article>
<paragraph>
<text>Rivermark Lynx withdrew veteran point guard Maya Cortes from all on‑court team activities on 5 September after a medical monitoring entry — submitted at 09:12 local time through the club’s secure medical portal using the standardized daily‑monitoring template — recorded an overnight increase in right‑knee mid‑patellar girth of +0.8 cm. The entry, time‑stamped and made visible to the head of medical services and the physiotherapy team, also logged a pre‑activity pain score of 3/10 and noted that Cortes had taken one 400 mg ibuprofen the previous evening. Following those findings, the club arranged an expedited, same‑day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre and informed the head coach and league administrators that Cortes would be temporarily unavailable for selection.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>The club’s monitoring notes specified that the mid‑patellar girth measurement was performed with a calibrated flexible tape at the anatomical mid‑point of the patella with Cortes supine and the knee in full extension, and the result was entered to the nearest 0.1 cm in accordance with the Lynx measurement protocol. Rivermark Lynx submitted a formal non‑availability notification on the club management system at 09:35 and secured an expedited ultrasound appointment at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre for 14:30 the same day, arranging for physiotherapist Sofia Harlow to accompany Cortes to the imaging using the club medical vehicle.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Rivermark Lynx notified Consultant Sports Medicine Physician Dr. Elias Verran and scheduled an urgent clinical review with him to follow the focused ultrasound, with further management to be determined after that assessment.</text>

Plan:
- Compare each factual statement in the article paragraphs against the provided ground truth. All statements in the article are supported by the ground truth.
- Make only minimal edits to improve flow and punctuation where helpful, without introducing any new facts or changing meaning.
- Document and justify any edits; if none are needed, state that.

Changes made and justification:
1. Retained all factual content — every factual statement in the original paragraphs matches the ground truth event information, so no content was removed or contradicted.
2. Minor punctuation and flow edits:
   - Removed an extra comma after "expedited" in paragraph 1 ("arranged an expedited, same‑day focused..." → "arranged an expedited same‑day focused...") to improve flow. This is a stylistic punctuation change only and does not alter facts.
   - Small phrasing adjustment in paragraph 2 for smoother reading ("the result was entered to the nearest 0.1 cm in accordance with the Lynx measurement protocol" → reordered slightly) without changing meaning.
   - No changes to names, times, measurements, actions, or attributions were made.
These are minimal edits aimed at clarity while preserving the article's original tone and all verified facts.

Goal: create 1 distinct subset that offers a coherent, newsworthy angle and enough detail for a story.
Key angles available:
- Transaction headline: signing/extension (N0-S0).
- Contract structure: reduced base + incentives (N0-S2) and incentive details (N0-S3).
- Fitness/availability after injury: medical assessment and clearance (N0-S4, N0-S5).
- Administrative/eligibility: roster filed/confirmed with league (N0-S6, N0-S7).
- Player sentiment: short statement/quote (N0-S8, N0-S9).

Choose combination that covers: announcement, financial terms, medical clearance, league registration, and player quote. Avoid redundancy: pick one of the near-duplicate registration sentences (use N0-S7 which includes confirmation), include detailed incentive sentence (N0-S3) to make contract terms specific, include the more detailed medical sentence (N0-S5), and use the direct player quote (N0-S9) for color.

Selected IDs: N0-S0, N0-S2, N0-S3, N0-S5, N0-S7, N0-S9
This produces a complete story: extension announced; terms; specifics of incentives; cleared medically with tests; league confirmed registration; player quote about earning minutes/fitness.

I reviewed the current-event sentences (N1-S0 to N1-S9). Key angles: medical clearance and successful full-contact session; detailed functional test results; coach's decision to make Cortes available but with a minutes-management plan; administrative step of submitting match-day availability; player quotes about readiness.

I want a single subset that gives a complete, newsworthy snapshot: on-court recovery, medical evidence, coach decision and limits, administrative confirmation she's eligible, and a player quote. I avoided redundant items (e.g., N1-S2 is covered by the more detailed N1-S3; N1-S7 about automated receipt is less important than the fact the club submitted availability in N1-S6). N1-S9 is similar to N1-S8 but longer; I chose the concise direct quote N1-S8 for clarity.

Final selection: N1-S0, N1-S1, N1-S3, N1-S4, N1-S5, N1-S6, N1-S8 — these together form a coherent news story about Cortes being cleared for selection with managed minutes and administrative confirmation, plus a direct quote.

<text>Rivermark Lynx medical staff withdrew veteran point guard Maya Cortes from the finalized match-day roster on 2025-08-29 after a pre-match physical assessment recorded mild swelling in her right knee. The club physiotherapist documented a mid-patellar girth difference of approximately 1.4 cm when comparing the right knee to the left and noted a small suprapatellar fluid wave on bedside palpation at about 17:10 local time. Following the assessment, the physiotherapist administered 400 mg of ibuprofen orally and applied a pneumatic cold-compression cuff set to approximately 6°C in 20-minute cycles, recording pre- and post-treatment pain scores on a 0–10 scale. The Rivermark Lynx head of medical services informed the head coach and submitted the formal withdrawal through the league match-day change portal at 17:25, with arena match officials informed shortly thereafter.</text>

Goal: create one versatile subset that tells a clear, newsworthy account of the medical reassessment and short-term management plan for Maya Cortes on 2025-08-30.

Key elements to include:
- Specialist review of imaging (establishes who reviewed and basis of decision).
- Imaging findings (small effusion, intact tendons — explains limited severity).
- Clinical exam results (range of motion, pain scores, stability — supports decision).
- Clearance decision and explicit minutes cap (main news hook: cleared but restricted).
- Details defining the minutes cap (how it will be managed in-game).
- Ongoing monitoring instructions (daily checks; what will be recorded).
- Planned one-week functional review and its testing (shows follow-up and potential for changing minutes).

Why these sentences:
- N3-S0 gives the time and person who reviewed the imaging (context/authority).
- N3-S1 communicates the ultrasound result and rules out major tendon injury.
- N3-S3 provides objective clinical findings (pain, ROM, stability).
- N3-S4 states the clearance and the conservative minutes cap (central news).
- N3-S5 explains the operational detail of that cap (useful for coaches/fans).
- N3-S6 & N3-S7 detail the daily monitoring protocol (club diligence and safeguards).
- N3-S8 & N3-S9 show the scheduled one-week reassessment and the specific tests to be used to decide on minutes increases.

Omitted items:
- N3-S2 (timestamp of repeat exam) is redundant given S0 and S3.
This subset yields a comprehensive, coherent story: specialist review → findings → conditional clearance with strict minutes management → daily monitoring → scheduled functional reassessment.

Rivermark Lynx point guard Maya Cortes cleared for limited match minutes after targeted knee ultrasound
</headline>
<article>
<paragraph>
<text>At 08:00 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran reviewed the focused musculoskeletal ultrasound images supplied by Harborfen Diagnostic Centre and recorded a small anechoic suprapatellar effusion on the images measuring approximately 7–9 mm in depth, noted intact patellar and quadriceps tendon continuity, and observed no focal Doppler hyperemia suggestive of active tendinopathy. Dr. Verran documented active knee extension of 0° and flexion to 135° bilaterally, a resting visual analogue pain score of 1/10 rising to 2/10 with single-leg squat provocation, and stable anterior drawer and Lachman tests with no joint-line tenderness. At 08:35 on 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran cleared Maya Cortes for match selection with an initial conservative minutes cap of 10–12 minutes.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>The minutes cap was defined as total in-game time per match for the immediate fixtures, to be delivered in no more than two separate stints and with coaching instructed to minimise prolonged high-intensity defensive minutes during each appearance. On 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran instructed the Rivermark Lynx medical team to perform daily symptom checks for Maya Cortes before and after training and match activity, and asked the Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist to record a pre- and post-activity 0–10 pain score, a brief patellar girth measure, a 30-second single-leg balance assessment, and any analgesic use, and to upload these entries to the club medical portal within two hours of each check.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>On 2025-08-30 Dr. Elias Verran scheduled a one-week functional review at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre to reassess load tolerance for Maya Cortes and notified Rivermark Lynx coaching staff of the plan. The one-week functional review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre and will include repeat targeted ultrasound, standardized isokinetic quadriceps/hamstring strength testing and a monitored five-minute on-court conditioning set to determine criteria for incremental minutes increases.</text>

- Review each paragraph against the ground-truth event information. The generated article already matches the ground truth closely.
- Make only minimal, non-substantive edits to improve readability and punctuation (e.g., add commas after timestamps/dates, reduce a run-on sentence by adding a conjunction break) while preserving the original tone and structure.
- Do not change any factual content or introduce new facts.
- Document and justify each minor change in this scratchpad.

Changes made and justification:
1. Inserted commas after timestamps/dates ("At 08:00 on 2025-08-30, ..." and "At 08:35 on 2025-08-30, ...") to improve readability. This is a stylistic punctuation change only; no factual content altered.
2. Slightly reflowed the second paragraph by breaking a long sentence into clearer segments with punctuation and conjunctions to reduce run-on feel (kept all facts and phrasing intact). This only affects sentence flow, not facts.
3. Added a comma after the scheduled review time ("booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06, ...") for consistency and readability.

No factual statements were removed or modified in substance; all statements are supported by the provided ground truth.

Goal: produce one subset of sentences from the 2025-09-05 current event that forms a coherent, newsworthy account and offers enough detail for reporters.

Key points to include:
- That the physiotherapist uploaded daily monitoring entries (establishes official record) — N4-S0.
- The upload timestamp and portal visibility (adds credibility/traceability) — N4-S1.
- Evidence of deterioration: increase in mid-patellar girth +0.8 cm — N4-S2.
- Measurement method could add medical precision and reduce ambiguity — N4-S3 (optional).
- Reported symptoms and analgesic use: pre-activity pain 3/10 and 400 mg ibuprofen (context for withdrawal) — N4-S4.
- Immediate team action: withdrawal from on-court activities and arranged expedited same-day ultrasound — N4-S6.
- Administrative steps and logistics: formal non-availability notification, scheduled 14:30 ultrasound and physiotherapist accompaniment — N4-S7 (gives detail on timing and club response).
- Medical escalation and stakeholder notification: alerted Dr. Elias Verran and scheduled urgent clinical review; head coach and league informed — N4-S8 and N4-S9 (both add procedure and timeline: encrypted email/phone alert, plan to review within two hours, league portal updated).

Avoid redundancy: N4-S5 repeats ibuprofen timing (covered in N4-S4). N4-S6 and N4-S7 overlap but N4-S7 has the more specific logistics timestamp; include both N4-S6 and N4-S7? N4-S6 states withdrawal and expedited ultrasound arranged; N4-S7 gives formal notification time and specific appointment time. Keep both for clarity.

Final selection: combine N4-S0, N4-S1, N4-S2, N4-S3, N4-S4, N4-S6, N4-S7, N4-S8, N4-S9. This set tells a full, traceable narrative: monitored change detected, symptoms noted, immediate withdrawal and diagnostics, formal notifications and medical escalation with timeline.

<text>Rivermark Lynx physiotherapist Sofia Harlow uploaded daily monitoring entries for Maya Cortes to the Rivermark Lynx club medical portal on 2025-09-05, prompting the club to withdraw the veteran point guard from all on-court team activities and arrange an expedited same-day focused musculoskeletal ultrasound at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre. The uploaded entry — submitted at 09:12 local time through the Rivermark Lynx secure medical portal using the club's standardized daily-monitoring template — was time-stamped and made visible to the head of medical services and the physiotherapy team, and recorded an overnight increase in right-knee mid-patellar girth of +0.8 cm in the Rivermark Lynx medical log. The mid-patellar girth measurement was performed with a calibrated flexible tape at the anatomical mid-point of the patella with Maya Cortes supine and the knee in full extension, and the result was entered to the nearest 0.1 cm per the club's measurement protocol; the entry also recorded a pre-activity pain score of 3/10 and documented one 400 mg ibuprofen taken the previous evening.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Following the monitoring entries, Rivermark Lynx submitted a formal non-availability notification on the club management system at 09:35, secured an expedited ultrasound appointment at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre for 14:30 the same day, and arranged for physiotherapist Sofia Harlow to accompany Maya Cortes to the imaging using the club medical vehicle. The club notified Dr. Elias Verran and scheduled an urgent clinical review with Dr. Elias Verran to follow the focused ultrasound while informing the head coach and league administrators of Cortes' temporary non-availability for selection; Dr. Elias Verran was alerted via encrypted email and an urgent phone call at 09:40 with the plan to perform a clinical review within two hours of the completed ultrasound, and the club also updated the league portal with a temporary 'medical' status and phoned the head coach to brief him on Maya Cortes' non-availability.</text>

Plan and approach:
- Compare every factual statement in the two article paragraphs against the provided ground truth event_info and entities.
- Maintain the original article's tone, vocabulary and sentence structure; make only minimal edits if any statements are unverifiable or incorrect.
- If all statements are verifiable, leave paragraphs unchanged (aside from extremely minor punctuation tweaks for flow, only if necessary).
- Provide justification for changes: if none are made, state that explicitly and explain why.

Findings:
- All factual statements in both paragraphs are directly supported by the ground truth event_info (timestamps, measurements, actions taken, personnel and organisations involved).
- The descriptor "veteran point guard" is consistent with the ground-truth description of Maya Cortes as a driven and disciplined veteran athlete and her profession as a point guard.
- No unverifiable or incorrect factual statements were identified.

Decisions:
- Make no substantive factual changes to the paragraphs. Retain original phrasing and structure to preserve style and readability.
- No third paragraph is required.

Justification:
- Because every sentence in the article paragraphs is supported by the supplied ground truth, retaining the original content maintains accuracy and the article's original style. No hedging or removal was necessary.

- The provided <entities> and <history> sections are empty, so there are no prior named-entity definitions or historical events to conflict with the outline.
- Checked internal numeric/time consistency in the outline:
  - Sera Lortin's time: 1:59.86.
  - Previous meet record: 2:00.26. Difference = 0.40 seconds → matches "lowered the meet record by 0.4 seconds."
  - Margin to second-place: 0.35 seconds → second-place time would be 1:59.86 + 0.35 = 2:00.21 (this is consistent and implies the second-place time also would be faster than the old record, which the outline does not assert or contradict).
  - Coach's negative split: second 100m = 59.20; first 100m therefore = 1:59.86 − 0.98? (wait) Correct calculation: 1:59.86 = 119.86 seconds total; second 100 = 59.20 seconds -> first 100 = 119.86 − 59.20 = 60.66 seconds = 1:00.66. This is a valid negative split (second 100 faster than first 100), consistent with coach's statement.
  - Attendance (~380) and other details (team points, margin, field size, timing of PDF posting) are plausible and internally consistent.
- No named entities in the outline contradict any provided entity list (there is none), and no historical events to conflict with.
- Conclusion: No inconsistencies found. No changes required.

Known follow-ups in the provided history: officials posted updated meet results within an hour and forwarded Sera Lortin's 1:59.86 to the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation for formal ratification; no specific ratification date or additional scheduled events are listed. Given typical regional federation processes, formal ratification and any subsequent selection/invitations would plausibly occur within days to a few weeks after 2025-07-12, so the following continuation is set shortly after that date and remains consistent with the recorded actions.
</thought_process>

<summary>
<text>The Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation formally ratified Sera Lortin's 1:59.86 as the new 200m freestyle meet record on 2025-07-16 and issued an invitation for her to attend the federation's under-17 development camp later that month.</text>
<date>2025-07-16</date>
</summary>

<thought_process>
The history shows Merrowgate Development Squad and coach Ivo Harlen were directly involved in Sera's performance and training; a realistic short-term follow-up after an intense championship is a training setback or medical precaution, which is consistent with normal athlete management and does not contradict the federation's ratification process; this continuation is scheduled a few days after the meet to reflect a typical post-competition check and conservative training response.
</thought_process>

<summary>
<text>Merrowgate Development Squad announced on 2025-07-19 that Sera Lortin would skip the club's planned post-championship time trial due to a minor left-shoulder strain and that coach Ivo Harlen had adjusted her training pending a physiotherapy assessment.</text>

Include Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation, Sera Lortin, Merrowgate Development Squad, Ivo Harlen, and introduce a new under-17 head coach name (Nadia Varnell).

<scratchpad>We need to add one supplemental sentence after each original outline sentence, keeping originals unchanged. Add plausible, reporter-knowable specifics: ratification administrative details; honorarium logistics (purpose, payment channel, timing); evaluation location and structure (duration, in-pool/video); what Ivo will bring to evaluation (training log, splits); selection committee process timing and criteria (review window, objective criteria). Avoid introducing new events or people, keep everything consistent with known entities and history. Ensure each added sentence is self-contained and refers to entities by name, not pronouns.</scratchpad>

I checked the new outline against the provided entities and the prior history.

- The history (2025-07-12) shows that Brindemoor Aquatic Complex hosted the Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship, Sera Lortin set a 1:59.86 meet record, Merrowgate Development Squad won the team title, and officials forwarded Sera Lortin's time to the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation for formal ratification. The outline's opening item (formal ratification on 2025-07-16) is consistent with that.

- Named entities in the outline:
  - Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation — present in the entities list and matches.
  - Sera Lortin — present and consistent.
  - Merrowgate Development Squad — present and consistent.
  - Ivo Harlen — present and consistent.
  - Valemont Sports Council Building — listed as the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation headquarters in the entities; using it as the location for the evaluation is consistent.
  - Nadia Varnell — not previously listed among PERSONS, but introducing a federation under-17 head coach does not contradict any established facts. This is an acceptable, minimal addition.

- Other details (ratification letter signed by the federation secretary, honorarium processed via Merrowgate Development Squad's administrative account, 14-day remittance notification, 45-minute slot split into 20/15/10 minutes, selection committee review within 72 hours, use of published under-17 selection criteria) are all plausible and do not conflict with the history or entity data.

No inconsistencies were found that require corrections. All storyitems can stand as written. I will output the outline unchanged, maintaining use of full names for entities.

- Merrowgate Development Squad (organization) — already in entities.
- Ivo Harlen (person) — already in entities.
- Nadia Varnell (person) — NEW (not present in provided entities).
- Valemont Sports Council Building (building) — present in existing entities as the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation's headquarters field.
- Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation selection committee (organizational subunit) — explicitly named in outline; NOT present in provided entities (no entry for selection committee).
- Brindemoor Aquatic Complex (building) — already in entities.
- Other terms (honorarium, administrative account, one-on-one evaluation, performance database, 8x100 race-pace sets, remittance notification, written evaluation, under-17 selection criteria) are descriptive or document/abstract references, not named entities per instructions.

REVIEW AGAINST EXISTING ENTITIES:
- Nadia Varnell: no matching <person> in existing XML — include as new <person>.
- Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation selection committee: not listed as a separate organization in existing XML. The main federation exists, but the selection committee is explicitly named and distinct; include as new <organization>.

DECISIONS / NOTES:
- Did not include "Valemont Sports Council Building" as new because it appears in the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation headquarters field in the existing organization entry.
- Did not create entities for generically described items (administrative account, performance database, honorarium) as they are not proper named entities.
- Treated the "selection committee" as an organization per guidance to prefer organization when in doubt about group/subunit names.

- Sera Lortin (person) — already present in entities.
- Merrowgate Development Squad (organization) — already present in entities.

- Valemont Sports Council Building (building) — referenced in existing organization entry as the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation headquarters; treated as already present in the provided XML (appears in that field) → not new.
- "Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation selection committee" (organizational subunit) — explicitly named in the outline but exceeds the 5-word limit you requested. Also it is a subunit of an existing organization (the Federation), not clearly modeled as an independent organization in the provided XML.

DECISION LOGIC:
- RULE: Must use full names as they appear in the OUTLINE and only list entities not already in <entities>.
- CONSTRAINT (from your feedback): Named entity should not exceed 5 words.
- ACTION: Remove the selection-committee entry because its full name in the outline has 6 words and the user requested named entities be ≤5 words. Additionally, the committee is a subunit of an existing organization, supporting omission.
- RETAIN: Nadia Varnell as a new person (name appears exactly and is not in the provided entities).

Known follow-up events from the history: the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation scheduled a one-on-one evaluation between Sera Lortin and under-17 head coach Nadia Varnell on 2025-07-22 (45-minute slot: 20-minute in-pool technical review, 15-minute video stroke analysis, 10-minute training discussion), and the Federation also stated a one-time honorarium would be processed via Merrowgate Development Squad's administrative account with a remittance notification to be issued within 14 days of 2025-07-16. Both new summaries must therefore either concern the scheduled 2025-07-22 evaluation or occur on/before that date; I selected one event happening before the evaluation (honorarium remittance processed) and one event describing the scheduled evaluation itself. These continuations are consistent with the timeline and details already given, remain within the sports context, focus on named entities (Sera Lortin, Merrowgate Development Squad, Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation, Nadia Varnell), and present plausible, neutral developments (one administrative/low-impact item and one assessment/medium-impact item).

The event is a regional youth swimming championship, so the focus should be on athletes, competition, venue, and immediate outcomes. The date needs to be generated as none was provided. Based on the genre (Sports) and the context (local youth competition with a record-breaking performance), a plausible recent date in the current timeline is appropriate—let's choose 2025-04-12, a mid-spring date suitable for indoor aquatic events.

The main competitor is a 16-year-old who breaks the meet record in the 200-meter freestyle by 0.4 seconds. The outcome leads to a team title for a mixed-age development squad, suggesting a program emphasizing long-term athlete development. Therefore, the outline should include the race execution, the time improvement, the team result, a reaction from a relevant coach or official, and a mention of the venue where it occurred.

No named entities currently exist in the known list, so all new entities must be invented with fictional names. The venue should be a named indoor aquatic center. The athlete and coach are new characters. The team may be named after a regional development program. Names should be plausible-sounding and original (e.g., combining syllables from common names or geographic references).

All story items must be atomic, sequential, and only contain one fact each. Avoid pronouns—each named entity must be referenced by full name. Ensure logical flow: preparation, race, result, team consequence, and reaction.

The tone must stay realistic and grounded—no exaggeration. The impact should be regional and developmental in nature. No technology, no space, no global reach.

Final story items: (1) Event date and venue (2) Performance in the 200m freestyle (3) Record-breaking time (4) Team result (5) Coach’s statement.

The event is a regional youth swimming championship, so the focus should remain on athletic performance, team dynamics, and local significance. The key details to enrich are:

1. The location: Taryn Aquatic Center — this is a specific building, so we can add architectural or logistical details that are plausible and consistent with an indoor aquatic center (e.g., number of lanes, seating capacity, presence of a warm-up pool).
2. The athlete: Kaelen Rostova — a 16-year-old competitor. We can add details about their background (e.g., hometown, previous achievements, training regimen) without contradicting the known entities or history.
3. The time: 1:57.32 — this is a precise time, so we can contextualize it by comparing it to national youth standards or regional benchmarks, but only if such data is plausible and not exaggerated.
4. The team: Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad — a mixed-age squad. We can add details about the age range of team members, their training schedule, or how the team is structured.
5. Coach Miriam Kevan’s quote — we can include a brief, specific detail about her coaching philosophy or her role in the program, as this adds depth without overreaching.
6. The meet record: broken by 0.4 seconds — this is a small margin, so we can mention the previous record holder or the previous record time to ground the achievement.

All added details must be specific, plausible, and consistent with the genre (sports), the setting (regional youth competition), and the absence of any prior history or known entities. No technological or global claims are allowed. Focus on human, local, and athletic details.

Possible dimensions to enrich:
- Venue: number of lanes, seating, presence of a spectator gallery.
- Athlete: hometown, previous meet results, training hours per week.
- Team: number of participants, age distribution, coach’s tenure.
- Record: previous record time, previous record holder (if known locally).
- Coach: her background, how long she’s been with the squad.

All new details must be self-contained and not rely on pronouns. They must be added directly after the original sentence they support.

The outline describes a fictional event on 2025-04-12 involving the Taryn Aquatic Center, swimmer Kaelen Rostova, and the Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad. The entities mentioned—Taryn Aquatic Center, Kaelen Rostova, Coach Miriam Kevan, and the Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad—are all consistent with the provided list of entities, as they are present in the respective categories (LOCATIONS, PERSONS, ORGANIZATIONS, and EVENTS). 

No prior history is provided in the &lt;history&gt; section, so there are no previous events to contradict the current outline. Therefore, there are no inconsistencies in the timeline or entity usage.

The timeline is plausible: Kaelen Rostova, a swimmer from Lirin, has trained with the Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad since 2022 (three years prior to 2025), and previously placed second in the 2024 Northern District Youth Championships—this aligns with her being a competitive athlete in 2025.

The record-breaking time of 1:57.32 in the 200-meter freestyle, breaking the previous record of 1:57.72 set in 2022 by a swimmer from the Westhaven Aquatic Club, is consistent. No contradiction arises from this, as the record was set in the past and is now surpassed.

Coach Miriam Kevan’s background—serving since 2021 and having competed in 2008 and 2012—fits logically with her current role in 2025. Her age would be consistent with someone who competed in the early 2000s and is now coaching.

All story items are factually consistent with each other and with the provided entity list. No changes are required.

IDENTIFICATION OF NAMED ENTITIES FROM OUTLINE:

1. "Taryn Aquatic Center" – explicitly named as a facility where the event took place. It is a structure designed for swimming and public use. This fits the definition of a building. It is not just a generic "aquatic center" but has a specific name.

2. "200-meter freestyle event" – this is a specific competition event within the championship. It is explicitly named and refers to a particular race. This fits the definition of an event.

3. "Kaelen Rostova" – a swimmer explicitly named. This is a person.

4. "Lirin" – a town mentioned as the hometown of Kaelen Rostova. This is a geographical location, specifically a town, so it fits the definition of a location.

5. "Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad" – a team of swimmers with a specific name. This is a group of people working together for a common purpose (swimming development), so it fits the definition of an organization.

6. "Westhaven Aquatic Club" – a swim club mentioned as the previous record holder’s team. This is a group of swimmers with a specific name, so it fits the definition of an organization.

7. "2024 Northern District Youth Championships" – a specific competition event that occurred in 2024. It is explicitly named and refers to a past regional competition. This fits the definition of an event.

8. "Coach Miriam Kevan" – a person explicitly named. This is a person.

9. "2008 and 2012 regional youth swimming circuits" – these are references to past competitions, but they are not named as specific events. They are described as "regional youth swimming circuits" and not given a unique name. Therefore, they do not count as named entities.

10. "1:57.72" – a time, not a named entity.

11. "1 minute, 57.32 seconds" – a time, not a named entity.

12. "six-lane, 25-meter competition pool" – a description of a feature, not a named entity.

13. "spectator capacity of 850" – a statistic, not a named entity.

14. "dedicated warm-up lane" – a feature, not a named entity.

15. "the previous meet record" – refers to a record but not by name. Not a named entity.

16. "the team title" – a result, not a named event.

17. "14 swimmers ranging in age from 13 to 18" – a description, not a named entity.

18. "six of them competing in their first regional championship" – a description, not a named entity.

19. "Kaelen’s poise under pressure and the squad’s unity" – descriptive phrases, not named entities.

20. "the program" – refers to the development squad, but not a named entity.

So, the explicitly named entities from the outline are:

- Taryn Aquatic Center (building)
- 200-meter freestyle event (event)
- Kaelen Rostova (person)
- Lirin (location)
- Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad (organization)
- Westhaven Aquatic Club (organization)
- 2024 Northern District Youth Championships (event)
- Coach Miriam Kevan (person)

Now, check against existing <entities> (which is empty):

Since <entities> is empty, all of the above are new.

Now, verify for redundancy or overlap:

- "Taryn Aquatic Center" and "Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad" are distinct: one is the facility, the other is the team within it. Both are named and distinct.

- "Westhaven Aquatic Club" is a separate organization from the Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad.

- "2024 Northern District Youth Championships" is a different event from the "200-meter freestyle event" and the "regional youth swimming championship" (which is the main event on 2025-04-12).

- "Kaelen Rostova" and "Coach Miriam Kevan" are two distinct people.

- "Lirin" is a town, not a person or organization.

No duplicates or redundancies.

Now, check if any should be classified differently:

- "Taryn Aquatic Center" – clearly a building (specific structure with a name). Correctly classified.

- "200-meter freestyle event" – a specific competition within a larger event. It is named and distinct. Correctly classified as event.

- "2024 Northern District Youth Championships" – a named competition. Correctly classified as event.

- "Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad" – a team with a name. It is an organization.

- "Westhaven Aquatic Club" – a swim club with a name. Organization.

- "Kaelen Rostova" – person.

- "Coach Miriam Kevan" – person.

- "Lirin" – a town. Location.

All classifications are correct.

No entity should be classified as miscellaneous. All fit clearly into their categories.

Final list of new named entities:

- <building>Taryn Aquatic Center</building>
- <event>200-meter freestyle event</event>
- <person>Kaelen Rostova</person>
- <location>Lirin</location>
- <organization>Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad</organization>

- <event>2024 Northern District Youth Championships</event>

Note: "Coach Miriam Kevan" is the full name as used in the outline. It is not just "Miriam Kevan" — the title "Coach" is part of the named reference.

All are explicitly named and not present in the empty <entities> list.

No abbreviations or variations to remove.

<thought_process>
The history of events ends on 2025-04-12 with the conclusion of the regional youth swimming championship at the Taryn Aquatic Center. The key events documented include: Kaelen Rostova breaking the 200-meter freestyle record, the Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad winning the team title, and praise from Coach Miriam Kevan. No follow-up events are explicitly mentioned in the history that are scheduled beyond this date.

Given this, all future summaries must be set on dates after 2025-04-12, and any plausible developments must remain consistent with the existing context: a regional youth swimming championship in Kershan, a focus on athletic development, and ongoing activities of the Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad, Westhaven Aquatic Club, and individual athletes/coaches.

The most plausible next steps include:
- Individual athlete progression (e.g., selection for a larger competition, injury, training updates).
- Organizational developments (e.g., squad expansion, funding, mentorship programs).
- Recognition or follow-up events (e.g., media coverage, internal team reviews, scholarship opportunities).
- Competitive context (e.g., rival teams reacting, past record holder acknowledging change).

I will generate two distinct, plausible, low-to-medium impact continuations:
1. A positive development focusing on Kaelen Rostova being invited to a national-level training camp — a natural progression after his record-breaking performance.
2. A moderate, slightly negative development: Coach Miriam Kevan facing internal team scrutiny due to the squad's focus on one athlete, reflecting real-world dynamics in youth sports.

Both events are set after 2025-04-12, consistent with the timeline, and involve named entities from the known list (Kaelen Rostova, Miriam Kevan, Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad, and possibly the Northern Kershan Youth Sports Authority).

The known history establishes that on 2025-04-12, Kaelen Rostova achieved a record-breaking performance in the 200-meter freestyle at the regional youth swimming championship, setting a new meet record of 1:57.32. He was a member of the Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad under Coach Miriam Kevan. The continuation summary provided indicates that Kaelen was selected to attend the Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp in July 2025, following his success. This represents a positive, medium-impact development, consistent with typical progression paths for elite youth athletes in national sports systems. The event date in the summary is 2025-06-18, which is prior to the July camp, making it a plausible administrative or organizational step (e.g., official confirmation, invitation, or orientation).

To generate contradictory alternative summaries, the key is to maintain:
- The central topic: Kaelen Rostova’s post-championship development.
- The main entity: Kaelen Rostova.
- The stance: Positive (as his record-breaking performance and team success are established as achievements).
- The impact: Medium (not global, but significant in the regional or national youth sports context).
- The date: 2025-06-18.

Therefore, the alternatives must present contrasting yet plausible next steps that cannot coexist with one another and must not contradict the existing narrative or known entities. The alternatives must also be realistic, relevant to sports development, and avoid global-scale or non-sports-related changes.

One plausible contradiction is that instead of being selected for a national camp, Kaelen is delayed due to injury or administrative issues. Another is that he is recommended for a different program (e.g., academic scholarship). A third alternative could be that the selection is rescinded due to eligibility concerns.

All these alternatives are consistent with the date (2025-06-18), the characters involved, and the episode’s tone. They do not involve large-scale or unrealistic developments. Each outcome is mutually exclusive: only one can occur following the original event.

The event centers on a re-evaluation of Kaelen Rostova’s eligibility for a national training camp after a registration discrepancy was discovered. This follows the high-profile success of Kaelen at the 2025 regional youth swimming championship, where he broke the meet record. The new event must logically follow that timeline, occurring two months later (June 18, 2025), and maintain realism within the sport context.

The key points to include:
- The date is 2025-06-18, as provided.
- The event involves the North-Kershan Swimming Federation re-evaluating Kaelen’s registration due to a discrepancy.
- This leads to the rescinding of his selection to the Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp.
- The cause of the discrepancy must be plausible: a mismatch in birth date or age verification during registration.
- The Federation's internal review process must be described in realistic, procedural terms.
- The outcome should reflect consequences for the athlete and possibly his team, while not involving broader political or systemic fallout.
- The known entities (Kaelen Rostova, Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad, Coach Miriam Kevan, North-Kershan Swimming Federation) must be referenced, and their roles consistent with the history.

The story items should progress chronologically:
1. Announce the event date and decision by the Federation.
2. Detail the nature of the registration discrepancy identified.
3. Describe the reaction from Kaelen’s coach.
4. Clarify the impact on his training camp selection.
5. State the next step: a formal review process initiated by the Federation.

All names must be used in full, not abbreviated. No repetition of prior events. No use of superlatives or overstatement. The tone must remain objective and factual throughout.

I am analyzing the fictional event summary and outline to enrich it with new, specific, and plausible details that align with the genre of sports, the established history, and the known entities. The focus is on realism, consistency, and relevance to a sports news context.

Key dimensions to enrich:
- The nature of the discrepancy: birth date mismatch — this could involve administrative error, documentation confusion, or possible identity issues. Since Kaelen was born on 2008-06-14 and the event is in 2025, he would be 16–17 years old, which is within the junior age category. The discrepancy likely involves a clerical error in the form (e.g., 2008-06-14 vs. 2008-06-15), not a fundamental age eligibility issue.
- The review process: internal review by the North-Kershan Swimming Federation — this implies a formal verification step, possibly involving cross-checking with municipal records, which are held in Lirin.
- The impact on Kaelen: he was selected for the national training camp, which is a significant opportunity. The rescission affects his immediate development path.
- Coach Miriam Kevan’s response: she is a credible figure with a background in competition and coaching. Her concern suggests the issue may be procedural, not about Kaelen’s performance.
- The re-evaluation process: the federation is now verifying all athletes from the 2025 regional championship — this implies a broader administrative review, possibly due to a systemic issue or a single error that triggered a policy check.

I will now identify unspecific elements in each sentence and add one new, specific, and plausible detail per sentence, ensuring:
- No repetition of known facts (e.g., Kaelen’s birth date is already known from the entities).
- No introduction of technology beyond what’s implied (e.g., digital records, but not AI or blockchain).
- All new details are consistent with the setting (Kershan, small village, regional events, non-profit organizations).
- Details are of interest to a sports reporter: administrative processes, athlete impact, coach reactions, organizational procedures.

Potential new details:
- The specific form field where the error occurred (e.g., “birth date” field in the digital registration portal).
- The exact date the discrepancy was flagged (e.g., June 15, 2025).
- The name of the federation’s compliance officer involved.
- The exact municipal record source (e.g., Lirin’s municipal registry, dated 2023).
- The number of athletes already flagged for review.
- The timeline for the re-evaluation process.
- The specific training camp location (Velran Sports Complex) and its capacity.
- The fact that the Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad has a team administrator who handles documentation.
- The possibility that the error originated from a paper form submitted by the squad’s administrator.

All new details must be factual, specific, and plausible within the existing world.

The outline describes a fictional event on 2025-06-18 involving the rescission of Kaelen Rostova’s selection to the Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp due to a discrepancy in his birth date between his registration form and the official municipal record. The key inconsistency lies in the birth date: the provided entity data for Kaelen Rostova (PERSON-1) states his date of birth as 2008-06-14, while the outline claims he submitted 2008-06-15 in his registration form.

This is a direct contradiction. The entity list explicitly states:
- <date_of_birth>2008-06-14</date_of_birth> for Kaelen Rostova (PERSON-1)

However, the outline states:
- "Kaelen Rostova’s submitted birth date of 2008-06-15 did not match the official municipal birth record from Lirin’s registry, which listed 2008-06-14"

This implies that the registration form had a different date than the official record, but the official record (as per the entity) is 2008-06-14. Therefore, the registration form must have listed 2008-06-15 to be inconsistent — which is plausible, as a data entry error could have occurred.

However, the outline also states: "The Lirin municipal registry ... confirmed that the original birth certificate issued in 2008 listed the date as 2008-06-14", which aligns with the entity data. So the discrepancy is not in the official record, but in the registration form.

Thus, the inconsistency is not in the entity data, but in the narrative implication: the outline suggests that the registration form had a different date (2008-06-15), which is inconsistent with the entity’s known DOB (2008-06-14). But this is not a contradiction — it is a plausible error in data entry. The entity data is correct, and the outline describes a mistake in the form, which is acceptable.

No other inconsistencies are found:
- The Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad (ORGANIZATION-1) is correctly referenced as Kaelen’s team.
- Coach Miriam Kevan (PERSON-2) is correctly quoted.
- The Lirin municipal registry is consistent with the location entity (LOCATION-1).
- The Velran Sports Complex is not explicitly listed in the entities, but the outline describes it as the host of the national training camp. The Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad (ORGANIZATION-1) has its headquarters in Velran, which supports the idea that Velran is a known location for such events. The description of the Velran Sports Complex (50-meter Olympic pool, recovery center, etc.) is plausible and does not contradict any known facts.
- The North-Kershan Swimming Federation is the organizer of the regional championship (EVENT-1), so it is consistent to have them handle national camp selections.
- The number of athletes under review (12) is plausible and not contradicted.

Therefore, the outline is consistent with the provided entities and previous events. The only potential issue — the birth date discrepancy — is not a contradiction but a narrative device for a data entry error, which is reasonable and acceptable.

No changes are needed.

PROCESSING THE OUTLINE:

Step 1: Identify all named entities explicitly mentioned by name in the OUTLINE.

1. "Kaelen Rostova" – mentioned multiple times. Already exists in <entities> as PERSON-1. Not new.

2. "North-Kershan Swimming Federation" – mentioned in the first sentence. Check if it exists in <entities>:
   - In <entities>, we have:
     - <event><organizer>North-Kershan Swimming Federation</organizer></event>
     - But no <organization> with this name.
   - Therefore, "North-Kershan Swimming Federation" is not yet in the <entities> list as an organization.
   - It is explicitly named and refers to a governing body.
   - This is a new organization.

3. "Lirin" – already exists in <entities> as a location (LOCATION-1). Not new.

4. "Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad" – already exists in <entities> as ORGANIZATION-1. Not new.

5. "Coach Miriam Kevan" – already exists in <entities> as PERSON-2. Not new.

6. "Elara Voss" – mentioned as the team administrator. Not present in <entities>. Explicitly named. This is a new person.

7. "Velran Sports Complex" – mentioned as the venue for the national training camp. Not present in <entities>. Explicitly named. This is a new building.

8. "Velran" – mentioned as the headquarters of the Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad. But "Velran" is already in <organization><headquarters>Velran</headquarters></organization> as a location. However, "Velran" is a city/town, and "Velran Sports Complex" is a specific facility. Since "Velran Sports Complex" is a distinct named structure, it is a new building.

9. "2025 regional youth swimming championship" – this is a recurring event. It is referred to multiple times. However, it is not given a unique name. It is described as "the 2025 regional youth swimming championship" — this is a descriptive title, not a proper name. No unique name is given (e.g., "Kershan Regional Youth Swim Meet 2025"). Therefore, it does not qualify as a named entity.

10. "Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp" – this is a specific event. It is explicitly named and scheduled for July 5–12, 2025. It is not present in <entities>. This is a new event.

11. "Lirin municipal registry" – this is a government body. It is mentioned as maintaining records. However, it is not given a unique name (e.g., "Lirin City Registry Office"). It is referred to descriptively. Therefore, not a named entity.

12. "Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad’s administrative office" – this is a department or office within an organization. Not a named entity.

13. "digital registration portal" – generic term, not a named system.

14. "recovery center", "nutrition and sports psychology unit" – parts of the Velran Sports Complex, but not named entities.

15. "2025-06-18" – date, not a named entity.

16. "2008-06-15", "2008-06-14" – dates, not named entities.

17. "1:57.32" – time, not a named entity.

18. "12 athletes" – number, not a named entity.

19. "1,200 spectators" – capacity, not a named entity.

20. "50-meter Olympic-standard pool" – feature, not a named entity.

21. "formal re-evaluation process" – process, not a named entity.

22. "scanned copies of birth certificates and municipal ID forms" – documents, not named entities.

23. "Kaelen Rostova’s camp selection" – not a named entity.

24. "2025 regional championship" – again, descriptive, not a named event.

25. "2024 Northern District Youth Championships" – this is mentioned in the history of EVENT-2. It is referred to as "2024 Northern District Youth Championships" — this is a proper name. But it is already in <entities> as EVENT-2. So not new.

26. "200-meter freestyle event" – not a named event, just a category.

27. "Taryn Aquatic Center" – mentioned in the outline as the venue of the regional championship. But in <entities>, we have:
   - <building><name>A community-focused aquatic facility designed to support competitive and recreational swimming...</name></building>
   - This building is referred to as "Taryn Aquatic Center" in the outline.
   - However, in <entities>, the building is named with a long descriptive name, not "Taryn Aquatic Center".
   - But in the <building> entry, the <name> field is:
     "A community-focused aquatic facility designed to support competitive and recreational swimming, with recently upgraded training infrastructure and environmental efficiency measures."
   - This is not the same as "Taryn Aquatic Center".
   - However, in the <history> of the building, it says: "The Taryn Aquatic Center hosted the regional youth swimming championship on 2025-04-12..."
   - So the building is known as "Taryn Aquatic Center" in the narrative.
   - But in the <entities> list, the building is not named "Taryn Aquatic Center" — it has a long descriptive name.
   - Therefore, "Taryn Aquatic Center" is a name used in the outline, but not present in the <entities> list as a named building.
   - However, the building is already in <entities> as BUILDING-1. The name field is descriptive, but the entity is the same.
   - Since the name "Taryn Aquatic Center" is used in the outline and is not listed as a name in the <entities> list, we must consider whether it is a new named entity.

   BUT: The <building> entity in <entities> has:
   - <name>A community-focused aquatic facility designed to support competitive and recreational swimming...</name>
   - This is not the same as "Taryn Aquatic Center".
   - However, the <history> says: "The Taryn Aquatic Center hosted the regional youth swimming championship..."
   - So the building is referred to by the name "Taryn Aquatic Center" in the narrative.
   - But in the <entities> list, it is not listed with that name.
   - Therefore, "Taryn Aquatic Center" is a new named entity? But wait — the building is already in the list as BUILDING-1. The name field is descriptive, but the entity is the same.

   However, the instruction says: "Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story."

   The building is already in the list. The name field is descriptive, but the entity is the same. Since the name "Taryn Aquatic Center" is used in the outline and is not present in the <entities> list as a name, but the building is already there, we must ask: is "Taryn Aquatic Center" a new named entity?

   No — because the building is already in the list. The fact that the name field is descriptive does not mean the entity is not known. The entity is known by its ID BUILDING-1. The name "Taryn Aquatic Center" is a common name for it, but it is not a separate entity.

   Therefore, "Taryn Aquatic Center" is not a new named entity — it is the same building.

   But wait — the outline also mentions "Velran Sports Complex" — which is a different building.

   So far, the only new named entities are:

   - North-Kershan Swimming Federation (organization)
   - Elara Voss (person)
   - Velran Sports Complex (building)
   - Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp (event)

   Let’s verify each:

   a. North-Kershan Swimming Federation:
      - Not in <entities> as an organization.
      - Explicitly named.
      - Governing body.
      - New organization.

   b. Elara Voss:
      - Not in <entities>.
      - Explicitly named as "the team administrator".
      - New person.

   c. Velran Sports Complex:
      - Not in <entities>.
      - Explicitly named as the venue.
      - A specific facility.
      - New building.

   d. Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp:
      - Not in <entities>.
      - Explicitly named.
      - Scheduled event.
      - New event.

   Are there any others?

   - "Lirin municipal registry" — not named, just described.
   - "digital registration portal" — not named.
   - "Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad’s administrative office" — not named.
   - "recovery center", "nutrition and sports psychology unit" — not named.

   So only four new named entities.

   Step 2: Remove duplicates and ensure distinct names.

   All four have distinct full names.

   Step 3: Verify categories:

   - North-Kershan Swimming Federation → organization
   - Elara Voss → person
   - Velran Sports Complex → building
   - Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp → event

   Step 4: Check for redundancy.

   No duplicates.

   Step 5: Final check.

   - "Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp" — is this a new event? Yes. It is not the same as the 2025 regional championship or the 2024 Northern District Youth Championships. It is a separate, future event.

   - "Velran Sports Complex" — not in <entities>. The building in <entities> is "Taryn Aquatic Center", which is different.

   - "Elara Voss" — not in <entities>. Only Kaelen, Miriam, and the squad are listed.

   - "North-Kershan Swimming Federation" — not in <entities> as an organization. It is only referenced in events as an organizer.

   Therefore, all four are new.

   No other named entities are explicitly named.

   Final list:

   - <organization>North-Kershan Swimming Federation</organization>
   - <person>Elara Voss</person>
   - <building>Velran Sports Complex</building>
   - <event>Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp</event>

   No miscellaneous entities.

   No products, art, or other categories.

   All are distinct and explicitly named.

PROCESSING THE OUTLINE:

Step 1: Identify all named entities explicitly mentioned by name in the OUTLINE.

1. "Kaelen Rostova" – already exists in <entities> as PERSON-1. Not new.

2. "North-Kershan Swimming Federation" – mentioned in the first sentence. Not present in <entities> as an organization. This is a new organization.

3. "Lirin" – already exists in <entities> as a location (LOCATION-1). Not new.

4. "Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad" – already exists in <entities> as ORGANIZATION-1. Not new.

5. "Coach Miriam Kevan" – already exists in <entities> as PERSON-2. Not new.

6. "Elara Voss" – mentioned as the team administrator. Not present in <entities>. Explicitly named. This is a new person.

7. "Velran Sports Complex" – mentioned as the venue for the national training camp. Not present in <entities>. Explicitly named. This is a new building.

8. "2025 regional youth swimming championship" – this is a recurring event. It is referred to multiple times. However, it is not given a unique name. It is described as "the 2025 regional youth swimming championship" — this is a descriptive title, not a proper name. No unique name is given (e.g., "Kershan Regional Youth Swim Meet 2025"). Therefore, it does not qualify as a named entity.

9. "Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp" – this is a specific event. It is explicitly named and scheduled for July 5–12, 2025. It is not present in <entities>. This is a new event.

However, the instruction states: "a named entity should not exceed 5 words".

"Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp" has 6 words: Kershan, National, Junior, Swimming, Training, Camp.

Therefore, this entity exceeds the 5-word limit and must be revised.

We must check if it can be shortened or if it is acceptable.

But the rule is strict: "should not exceed 5 words".

So we must either:
- Find a shorter name used in the outline, or
- Determine that it is not a valid named entity due to length.

But in the outline, it is always referred to as "Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp".

No shorter version is used.

Therefore, it violates the 5-word limit and cannot be considered a valid named entity.

Alternative: Is there a shorter name used?

No. The outline never uses a shorter name.

Therefore, we must exclude it.

But wait — is there a possibility that "National Junior Swimming Training Camp" is the core name?

But the full name is "Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp", and the outline uses the full name.

Since it exceeds 5 words, it is invalid.

Therefore, we must remove it.

Now, re-evaluate:

New entities:

- North-Kershan Swimming Federation → 4 words → valid (organization)
- Elara Voss → 2 words → valid (person)
- Velran Sports Complex → 3 words → valid (building)

"Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp" → 6 words → invalid.

Therefore, only three new named entities.

But wait — is there a shorter name for the event?

No.

Alternatively, could it be that the event is not a named entity because it is not a proper name?

But the instruction says: "Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story."

And "Kershan National Junior Swimming Training Camp" is a proper name used in the outline.

But it exceeds 5 words.

Therefore, it must be excluded.

Final list:

- North-Kershan Swimming Federation (organization)
- Elara Voss (person)
- Velran Sports Complex (building)

All are under 5 words.

No other entities.

Double-check:

- "Lirin municipal registry" — not named.
- "Taryn Aquatic Center Development Squad’s administrative office" — not named.
- "digital registration portal" — not named.
- "recovery center", "nutrition and sports psychology unit" — not named.
- "2025 regional championship" — descriptive, not a named event.

No other named entities.

Therefore, only three new named entities.

Known follow-up events to consider: (1) On 2025-07-12 Sera Lortin set a new meet record and Merrowgate won the team title; (2) On 2025-07-16 the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation ratified Sera's 1:59.86, announced a one-time honorarium (to be processed via Merrowgate), and scheduled a 45-minute one-on-one evaluation with under-17 head coach Nadia Varnell for 2025-07-22, with Merrowgate's coach Ivo Harlen to accompany Sera; (3) the Federation indicated the selection committee will review Nadia's written evaluation within 72 hours and apply published under-17 selection criteria when deciding any development-camp invitations. All three alternative continuations below are written for the same date (2025-07-22) and remain consistent with those prior facts (they treat Nadia's 45-minute evaluation as completed and her written recommendation as submitted); each is a positive, medium-impact sports development outcome but deliberately mutually exclusive regarding the immediate recommendation pathway (so if one occurs, the others cannot).

I compared the 2025-07-22 outline items to the established history and entities.

Findings:
- The scheduled 45-minute evaluation on 2025-07-22 at the Valemont Sports Council Building is consistent with the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation's prior scheduling and with Nadia Varnell's recorded appointment.
- The 10:00–10:45 timing matches the allocated 45-minute slot described in the history.
- Use of a portable high-frame-rate camera, timed short-pace sets, in-pool technical review, and subsequent written assessment are all consistent with the previously described evaluation format (20-minute in-pool/15-minute video/10-minute discussion).
- Nadia's noting of Sera Lortin's second-half pacing as a competitive strength aligns with earlier observations (Ivo Harlen's comments and Sera's negative split in the 200m).
- One small potential inconsistency: the original outline item 4 cited "an average split differential of roughly +0.15 seconds as evidence of Sera's reliable race-closing speed." The sign convention "+0.15 seconds" could be read to mean Sera was slower on the closing 50m (which would contradict the claim that closing speed is a strength and earlier evidence of faster second-half pacing). To remove ambiguity while preserving the original meaning (that the measured closing efforts were faster and supported the assessment), I changed the phrasing to state the differential as "roughly 0.15 seconds faster on the closing 50m." This is a minimal wording clarification that resolves the contradiction and keeps the original data point.
- All named entities in the outline are present in the entity list and used with their full names as required. Scheduling the clinic at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex is plausible and not in conflict with prior events.

No other inconsistencies were found. Only the one wording clarification (storyitem 4) was applied to resolve an ambiguity that could have been interpreted as contradictory.

Known scheduled follow-ups from the history: Merrowgate Development Squad committed to confirm Sera Lortin's availability and provide medical clearance and travel preferences within 48 hours of Nadia Varnell's 2025-07-22 evaluation (deadline ~2025-07-24); the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation requested participant logistics by 2025-07-28; the two-week regional skills clinic is scheduled at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex from 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18; the Federation also indicated the honorarium remittance would be issued within 14 days of the 2025-07-16 ratification (by ~2025-07-30). I generated two plausible, date-consistent continuations that either fulfil the 48-hour confirmation or present a realistic alternative (medical withdrawal) before the logistics deadline, each focusing on Sera Lortin and Merrowgate Development Squad and their interactions with the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation.

Known follow-up events from the history: on 2025-07-22 Nadia Varnell recommended a focused two-week regional skills clinic scheduled by the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex for 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18, and the Federation requested participant logistics (arrival time, emergency contact, dietary/accommodation needs) by 2025-07-28. Any communication from Merrowgate Development Squad on 2025-07-28 must therefore address Sera Lortin's availability for the clinic starting 2025-08-05 and satisfy the 07-28 logistics deadline.

I created three concise, neutral-tone, medium-impact alternatives dated 2025-07-28 that all concern Sera Lortin's condition and Merrowgate's notification to the Federation, and each is mutually exclusive with the others: (A) a full deferral request pending medical reassessment; (B) a request for partial (non-pool) participation while deferring in-pool work; and (C) a formal withdrawal to pursue private rehabilitation with intent to revisit participation later. Each alternative is consistent with the timeline and the Federation's earlier scheduling and logistics request for the 08-05 clinic.

<scratchpad>The outline has five sentences. For each, I will add one supplementary sentence with specific plausible details a reporter might know at this time, avoiding contradictions with the known history and entities. I will reference named entities directly (no pronouns), include times, methods of communication, and practical logistics that are likely to be known to a reporter (e.g., who sent an email, times, clinician requirements, arrival time, AV equipment). I will not introduce new subevents or outcomes beyond what is known, and will keep the scope local and realistic.</scratchpad>

I reviewed the July 28 outline against the established history and entity records.

Findings:
- All named entities in the outline match the provided entity list: Merrowgate Development Squad; Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation; Sera Lortin; Ivo Harlen; Brindemoor Aquatic Complex. The Valemont Sports Council Building was used previously for evaluation but is not referenced here — no conflict.
- The clinic dates and location (2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex) were established in the history and are referenced consistently.
- The Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation previously requested participant logistics by 2025-07-28. The July 28 email in this outline is consistent with that deadline.
- On 2025-07-22 Merrowgate Development Squad said it would aim to forward formal participation confirmation within 48 hours (i.e., by ~2025-07-24). The July 28 submission described here is later than that target. This is a minor timeline slippage but not a direct contradiction (the July 22 item used the wording "aim to forward" and did not create a firm obligation). It is plausible the club delayed and is instead providing an update on July 28.
- The medical clearance requirements in the outline (written by an accredited sports physician or chartered physiotherapist with diagnosis, limitations, recommendations) are consistent and do not contradict earlier requirements. Merrowgate offering its physiotherapist for on-site reassessment is consistent with prior offers of medical support.
- Ivo Harlen's confirmation to accompany Sera Lortin and to provide arrival time and emergency contact aligns with his previously stated role to accompany and coordinate next steps.
- Brindemoor Aquatic Complex placing a provisional hold on the classroom and confirming AV capability is consistent with earlier mentions of an on-site classroom reserved for daily video analysis.

Conclusion:
No substantive inconsistencies requiring changes. Only minor timeline slippage (Merrowgate's earlier "aim to forward within 48 hours" vs actual July 28 notification) exists but is plausible and does not require correction. I made minimal wording adjustments to ensure every reference to organizations uses their full name as required.

Known follow-up dates and requirements from the history: Merrowgate Development Squad was to submit Sera Lortin's clinician's medical clearance and arrival/accommodation information by 2025-07-30; coach Ivo Harlen gave a provisional arrival time of the evening of 2025-08-04; the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation scheduled the two-week regional skills clinic at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex to run from 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 and required a written clearance from an accredited sports physician or chartered physiotherapist before approving classroom-only participation. My continuations are constrained to either concern the clinic or occur before it, and I ensure date consistency with the 2025-07-30 submission deadline, the 2025-08-04 provisional arrival, and the 2025-08-05 clinic start; each summary focuses on at least one main named entity (Sera Lortin, Merrowgate Development Squad, Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation, Brindemoor Aquatic Complex, and Ivo Harlen) and represents a plausible sports-related next-step: one administrative/positive clearance outcome and one plausible adverse reassessment/withdrawal scenario prior to the clinic start.

Known follow-up events to respect: the two-week regional skills clinic is scheduled 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex; the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation required a written clinician's medical clearance before approving any classroom-only participation (request issued 2025-07-28); Merrowgate had offered its physiotherapist for on-site reassessment and indicated it would submit clearance and arrival information (communications referenced 2025-07-28 and a planned submission by 2025-07-30). The date for the reassessment in the provided continuation is 2025-08-04, one day before the clinic start; any plausible continuation must be consistent with those constraints and with typical sports-medical and federation procedures.

I kept the central topic (Sera Lortin's left-shoulder condition and the clinic attendance decision), the negative stance, and a medium-impact outcome for all alternatives, and used the same date (2025-08-04). I generated three mutually exclusive (contradictory) but realistic outcomes that follow from an on-site reassessment by Merrowgate's physiotherapist and are consistent with federation policy and the scheduled clinic timeline: (1) immediate withdrawal pending further imaging and specialist review (aligns with the original scenario), (2) same-day limited written clearance permitting classroom-only attendance under strict on-site physiotherapy supervision, and (3) same-day urgent imaging that confirms an acute strain leading to an enforced multi-week withdrawal and formal suspension from the clinic. Each summary is a single concise objective sentence dated 2025-08-04.

I checked the outline against the provided history and entities.

Findings:
- New named person Rowan Myles (Merrowgate Development Squad physiotherapist) is not in the entity list, but the history (2025-07-28) explicitly said Merrowgate offered its physiotherapist for on-site reassessment. Naming that physiotherapist as Rowan Myles is plausible and not contradictory.

- Dates/times: The outline is set on 2025-08-04, which matches the requested next event date. Ivo Harlen's arrival on the evening of 2025-08-04 is consistent with his previous provisional arrival time of the evening of 2025-08-04 from the 2025-07-28 history.

- The Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation required a clinician's written medical clearance before approving classroom-only participation (history 2025-07-28). The outline describes receipt and approval of such a clearance on the evening of 2025-08-04, followed by Federation approval at 21:14 — this is consistent in substance.

Inconsistency found:
- On 2025-07-28 Ivo Harlen / Merrowgate Development Squad committed to submitting the clinician's medical clearance and arrival information by 2025-07-30. The outline has the physiotherapist reassessing Sera Lortin and Merrowgate forwarding the clearance only on the evening of 2025-08-04. That conflicts with the earlier stated commitment to submit by 2025-07-30.

Resolution:
- Make a minimal change to the outline to acknowledge the scheduling delay: explicitly note Merrowgate had planned to submit by 2025-07-30 but scheduling constraints required the physiotherapist reassessment to occur on 2025-08-04, and the clearance was forwarded same-day. This preserves the original plot while removing the apparent contradiction.

No other inconsistencies were found. All other items (times, requirements for on-site monitoring, the Federation's conditional approval, Brindemoor classroom AV setup, and Ivo Harlen's guardian role and check-in time) are consistent with the history and named entities.

I will output the storyitems with a single minimal clarification to the relevant item about the timing of the clearance submission.

Known follow-up events from the history: the two-week regional skills clinic is scheduled to run 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex, with on-site physiotherapy monitoring required to begin with an 08:15 pre-class check on 2025-08-05; the Federation also indicated an honorarium remittance would be issued within 14 days of the 2025-07-16 ratification (i.e., by 2025-07-30). To remain consistent, both continuations either concern the clinic start (2025-08-05) or occur before it (on or before 2025-07-30). I therefore generated one summary about the expected honorarium remittance on 2025-07-30 (before the clinic) and one summary about the mandated 08:15 physiotherapy check on 2025-08-05 (the clinic start), ensuring each focuses on main named entities (Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation, Merrowgate Development Squad, Rowan Myles, Sera Lortin, Ivo Harlen) and follows the requirement that summaries be concise, realistic, and sport-focused.

Known follow-up events from the history: (1) On 2025-07-16 the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation ratified Sera Lortin's time and announced a one-time honorarium to be processed via Merrowgate Development Squad's administrative account with remittance notification within 14 days (i.e., by 2025-07-30); (2) Merrowgate requested classroom-only clinic participation on 2025-07-28 and aimed to submit medical clearance by 2025-07-30 but ultimately completed physiotherapy reassessment and sent clearance on 2025-08-04; (3) the Federation approved conditional classroom-only attendance after receipt of the 2025-08-04 clearance. All three proposed alternatives must therefore remain plausible on 2025-07-30 and not conflict with the later 2025-08-04 reassessment and the Federation's subsequent approval. Each alternative keeps the same central topic (honorarium/remittance for Sera Lortin), the same neutral/low-impact stance, and the same date, while introducing mutually exclusive administrative outcomes (successful direct credit to Sera's designated account; credit routed to the club's central scholarship fund instead of a named sub-account; or payment processed but held pending routine verification). These variants are consistent with how a small regional federation and a club might process modest honoraria and do not contradict the later medical-clearance timeline.

Potential pairs:
1. N0-S0 (event concluded on 2025-07-12) with N1-S0 (federation ratified on 2025-07-16) — both give specific dates; can compute exact day difference.
2. N0-S0 (2025-07-12 conclusion) with N1-S4 (evaluation scheduled for 2025-07-22) — both give specific dates; can compute exact day difference.
3. Considered N0-S1 (closed shortly after 6:30 p.m.) with N1-S0 (ratified 2025-07-16), but N1-S0 lacks a time of day so day-level comparison is cleaner using N0-S0.

<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]
N0-S0:
- Describe the time information from this sentence:
  - States the Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship concluded on 2025-07-12 at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex.
- Identify the event date:
  - 2025-07-12 (explicit in sentence).
Assumptions:
- None needed; the sentence gives an explicit calendar date for the championship conclusion.
Absolute dates:
- Conclusion of the championship = 2025-07-12.

N1-S0:
- Describe the time information from this sentence:
  - States the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation formally ratified Sera Lortin's time on 2025-07-16.
- Identify the event date:
  - 2025-07-16 (explicit in sentence).
Assumptions:
- None needed; the sentence gives an explicit calendar date for the ratification.
Absolute dates:
- Ratification = 2025-07-16.

Additional sentences:
- None required. Both selected sentences explicitly supply the two distinct absolute dates needed.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the championship's conclusion (date from N0-S0) and the federation's formal ratification (date from N1-S0).
- This requires extracting the two absolute dates from the two selected sentences and computing the difference; both sentences are necessary and neither alone suffices.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start date: 2025-07-12 (championship concluded per N0-S0).
- End date: 2025-07-16 (ratification per N1-S0).
- Compute difference: 2025-07-16 − 2025-07-12 = 4 days.

The original response largely met the task instructions: it extracted absolute dates from the two selected sentences, computed the elapsed time, and produced a concise question and answer. I checked each requirement from the task:

- Both selected sentences were used and are necessary to compute the duration: N0-S0 supplies the championship conclusion date, N1-S0 supplies the ratification date.
- The question did not include explicit dates and required extracting dates from the selected sentences.
- The answer is a concise time span ("4 days") and not a full sentence.
- The scratchpad in the original contained the derivation and assumptions.

Issue found (minor):
- The final output left <additional_sentence_ids> empty. The follow-up check instruction asks to list additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected in the previous response), if applicable. It is appropriate to list the two selected sentence IDs that supply the unique time information used to compute the duration.

Correction made:
- I will reproduce the same question and answer but include the selected sentence IDs (N0-S0 and N1-S0) under <additional_sentence_ids>, and explain the unique information each provides in <additional_sentence_explanation>.

<scratchpad>
Possible distractor ideas:
- "1 day" — plausible because officials posted results within an hour and forwarded the time to the federation (N0-S9); someone might assume ratification happened the next day.
- "2 days" — could be tied to a mistaken reading of July 12 to July 14; less directly supported by outline.
- "6 days" — could be confused with the 6-day gap between ratification (Jul 16) and the scheduled evaluation (Jul 22), but that misreads question.
- "10 days" — could confuse conclusion date (Jul 12) with evaluation date (Jul 22). Plausible but perhaps too large; might be less tempting than 1 day.
I will use "1 day" as the single distractor because it's highly plausible (fast forwarding of results implies quick action) yet clearly incorrect given the explicit ratification date of Jul 16 (4 days later). Use N0-S9 to support plausibility.

<distractor>
<answer>1 day</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the federation's formal ratification occurred on 2025-07-16, which is four days after the championship concluded on 2025-07-12, not one day later. This distractor is plausible because officials posted updated results and forwarded the time to the federation within an hour, which might suggest an immediate or next-day ratification.</explanation>

N0-S0:
- Time information: The sentence states "concluded on 2025-07-12".
- Event date: The event containing this sentence is dated 2025-07-12 (matches the sentence).
Assumptions:
- None needed; the sentence explicitly gives the conclusion date.
Absolute dates:
- Start point (championship conclusion): 2025-07-12.

N1-S4:
- Time information: The sentence states the evaluation is scheduled "for 2025-07-22".
- Event date: This sentence appears in the 2025-07-16 event, but the sentence itself specifies the scheduled date 2025-07-22 (a future scheduled date relative to the event).
Assumptions:
- The scheduled date 2025-07-22 is the intended single point in time for the evaluation.
Absolute dates:
- End point (scheduled evaluation): 2025-07-22.

Additional sentences:
- None required. Both selected sentences supply unique absolute dates needed to compute the span.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the duration between the championship's conclusion and the scheduled one-on-one evaluation. This requires extracting the date from N0-S0 and the scheduled date from N1-S4; both are necessary and neither can be omitted or replaced.

[Answer derivation]:

Findings:
- The previous answer correctly identified the two absolute dates (2025-07-12 and 2025-07-22), computed the duration as 10 days, and produced an appropriate question that avoids explicit dates.
- One minor omission: the previous response left <additional_sentence_ids> empty. The instructions ask to list additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected in the previous response), if applicable.

Possible distractor ideas:
- 4 days (confuse the ratification date 2025-07-16 with the evaluation date) — plausible because N1-S0 mentions 2025-07-16; distinct and clearly wrong when compared to July22.
- 6 days (count from ratification to evaluation: July16 to July22) — plausible but could be seen as counting between wrong events; might be confusing.
- 9 days (off-by-one from correct 10) — tempting but risk being too close and could be accidentally correct if inclusive/exclusive counting is misapplied.
- 14 days (two weeks) — less tied to outline, less plausible.

Select 4 days as the single distractor because it leverages a real date in the outline (ratification on 2025-07-16) and is a believable misreading while being definitively incorrect for the asked interval (Jul12 to Jul22 = 10 days).

2. N0-S0 (2025-07-12) paired with N2-S8 (clinic scheduled to run from 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18) — use the clinic start date 2025-08-05 to compute days between the championship and the clinic start (24 days).

Assumptions:
- Treat the dates given as calendar dates (no specific clock times required).
- The requested duration is the elapsed time between the two calendar dates (from the championship conclusion date to the evaluation completion date), measured in days. No inclusion of partial days is needed because no times are specified beyond dates.

Absolute dates:
- Championship conclusion: 2025-07-12 (from N0-S0).
- Evaluation completion: 2025-07-22 (from N2-S0).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the time span (in days) between the end of the championship (unique fact from N0-S0) and the completion of Nadia Varnell's scheduled evaluation (unique fact from N2-S0).
- Both sentences are required: N0-S0 supplies the start point (championship conclusion) and N2-S0 supplies the end point (evaluation completion). Without either sentence the start or end date would be unknown and the duration could not be computed.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The question asks for the duration between two events without stating absolute dates; it requires extracting dates from the two selected sentences (N0-S0 and N2-S0). This satisfies the requirement to avoid explicit dates in the question.
- The answer is a concise absolute duration ("10 days") and is not a full sentence, matching the instruction that the answer should only consist of the correct time span.
- The scratchpad in the previous response included explicit assumptions and derived absolute dates (2025-07-12 and 2025-07-22) and computed the elapsed days correctly as 10 days.
- The question depends on both selected sentences: N0-S0 provides the championship end date and N2-S0 provides the evaluation completion date. Neither sentence alone would allow the duration to be computed. No additional sentences are required.
- No other sentence in the complete outline is necessary or could replace either selected sentence to compute this specific interval; both selected sentences are unique and required.

- No corrections are necessary. I will reproduce the validated question-answer pair and explicitly note that no additional sentences are required.

Possible confusions:
- Mistaking the federation ratification date (2025-07-16) for the evaluation completion date (2025-07-22). That would give 4 days after the championship (7/12 to 7/16).
- Mistaking scheduled evaluation date (7/22) for clinic scheduling or deadlines (7/28 or 8/05), but those yield larger differences (16 or 19 days), less likely as a simple error.
- Using the final session closing time (shortly after 6:30 p.m.) or attendance numbers doesn't affect day count.

N0-S0:
- Describe the time information from this sentence:
  The sentence states that "The Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship concluded on 2025-07-12".
- Identify the event date:
  2025-07-12 (explicitly given).
Assumptions:
- Assume the championship's conclusion happened on 2025-07-12 (no time-of-day specified). We take the date as the relevant point in time (midnight-to-midnight date).
Absolute dates:
- Championship conclusion: 2025-07-12.

N2-S8:
- Describe the time information from this sentence:
  The sentence schedules "the two-week regional skills clinic ... to run from 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18".
- Identify the event date:
  The sentence itself gives the clinic start and end dates; the event date of that block (2025-07-22) is the event container date but the sentence provides its own absolute dates.
Assumptions:
- Use the clinic start date 2025-08-05 as the point marking the clinic's start. No time-of-day specified; use date as the point.
Absolute dates:
- Clinic start: 2025-08-05.
- Clinic end: 2025-08-18 (not needed for the chosen duration but recorded).

Additional sentences:
- None required. Both selected sentences uniquely provide the two absolute dates needed.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the number of days elapsed between the championship's conclusion (from N0-S0) and the start of the two-week clinic (from N2-S8). This requires both sentences: N0-S0 gives the earlier date; N2-S8 gives the later start date. No other sentence in the outline provides these two dates, so both are necessary.
- Word the question without including absolute dates; specify that the dates referenced are those given in the cited sentences.

[Answer derivation]:
- Championship conclusion: 2025-07-12.
- Clinic start: 2025-08-05.
Compute the elapsed days between 2025-07-12 and 2025-08-05:
- Days remaining in July after (and not including) July 12: July 13–31 = 19 days.
- Days in August up to and including August 5: August 1–5 = 5 days.

Possible common mistake: counting both start and end dates (inclusive) gives 25 days instead of 24. This uses the exact dates in the two sentences (2025-07-12 and 2025-08-05) so it's plausible. Other plausible but incorrect choices could be 23 (off-by-one), 19 (confusing with another date such as July 16 ratification), or 28 (mixing up the 28-point margin). Prefer 25 as it's a natural counting error and tied directly to the two required sentences (N0-S0 and N2-S8).

N0-S0:
- Time information: explicit absolute date given: "concluded on 2025-07-12".
- Event date: 2025-07-12 (matches the sentence's explicit date).

N3-S9:
- Time information: explicit absolute date range for the provisional hold: "for the 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 period".
- Event date: 2025-07-28 (the event that contains this sentence is dated 2025-07-28), but the sentence itself provides the future planned date range 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18.

Assumptions:
- We will measure the elapsed time in whole days as the simple difference between the two calendar dates (end date minus start date), not counting fractional days/hours.
- The "start" point is the championship's conclusion date (2025-07-12) as stated in N0-S0.
- The "end" point for the chosen question is the start date of the provisional hold window (2025-08-05) as stated in N3-S9.
- No other sentences are required to determine these two dates because both sentences explicitly supply the needed dates.

Absolute dates:
- Championship conclusion: 2025-07-12 (from N0-S0).
- Provisional hold start: 2025-08-05 (from N3-S9).

[Answer derivation]:
- Convert to ordinal day-of-year (2025 is not a leap year).
  - Days through June 30 = 181.
  - 2025-07-12 = 181 + 12 = day 193.
  - 2025-08-05 = 181 + 31 + 5 = day 217.
- Difference = 217 - 193 = 24 days.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the number of days elapsed between the championship's conclusion (from N0-S0) and the start of the provisional classroom hold window (from N3-S9).
- Unique required information:
  - From N0-S0: the exact date the championship concluded.
  - From N3-S9: the exact start date of the provisional hold (the hold's date range).
- Framing the question without giving dates forces the solver to extract both dates from the two sentences and compute the difference.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified the absolute dates in the two selected sentences (N0-S0 → 2025-07-12; N3-S9 → hold from 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18) and computed the elapsed time between 2025-07-12 and 2025-08-05 as 24 days. The arithmetic is correct.
- The question avoided repeating absolute dates (good), asked specifically for elapsed days, and required temporal reasoning using both sentences (good).
- The previous response included an explicit set of assumptions and a clear derivation — this aligns with instructions.

Minor issues / corrections:
- The previous response left <additional_sentence_ids> and <additional_sentence_explanation> empty. The instructions request listing any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected previously), and explaining the unique information each provides. Even if no new sentences are needed, the two selected sentences should be referenced here to show why they are necessary. I will add N0-S0 and N3-S9 in that field and provide brief explanations of the unique information each supplies.

No other corrections needed.

I will therefore reproduce the original question and answer, and add the missing additional sentence IDs and explanations. I will also restate the derivation succinctly.

Derivation summary:
- Championship conclusion: 2025-07-12 (N0-S0).
- Provisional hold start: 2025-08-05 (N3-S9).
- Days difference: From July 12 to August 5 = 24 days (31-12 = 19 days to July 31, plus 5 days in August → 19+5 = 24).

- Correct calculation: championship concluded 2025-07-12 (N0-S0). Brindemoor placed provisional hold starting 2025-08-05 (N3-S9). Difference = 24 days (exclusive day-count).
- Common mistake: counting inclusively (including both July 12 and Aug 5) yields 25 days — this is a plausible misread.
- Use supporting sentences that reference the same dates to make distractor believable: N0-S0 (championship date), N3-S9 (hold dates), and N2-S8 (clinic scheduled Aug 5–18) reinforce Aug 5 as start date.
- Draft one distractor: "25 days" with explanation that it's wrong because it results from inclusive counting of start and end dates.

N0-S1:
- Time information: "The final session closed shortly after 6:30 p.m." No exact minute given.
- Event date: 2025-07-12 (the event containing N0-S1 is dated 2025-07-12).

N3-S1:
- Time information: "The notification was sent in a 10:15 a.m. email ... and described the issue ... that first materialized after a timed interval set on 2025-07-25."
  The sentence gives an explicit email time (10:15 a.m.) and an explicit date for when the shoulder issue first materialized (after a timed interval on 2025-07-25). The email itself is within the event dated 2025-07-28, so the 10:15 a.m. email is on 2025-07-28 at 10:15 a.m.
- Event date: 2025-07-28 (the event containing N3-S1 is dated 2025-07-28).

Assumptions:
- "Shortly after 6:30 p.m." is not precise. To compute an absolute duration we must pick a specific minute. I assume "shortly after 6:30 p.m." means 6:35 p.m. on 2025-07-12. This is a plausible short interval (5 minutes) and is stated explicitly as an assumption in the question.
- The email time 10:15 a.m. is taken as 10:15 a.m. on the event date 2025-07-28 (this is explicitly given in N3-S1).

Absolute dates:
- Start point: 2025-07-12 at 6:35 p.m. (assumed per above).
- End point: 2025-07-28 at 10:15 a.m. (explicit in N3-S1; event date 2025-07-28).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the championship final's close ("shortly after 6:30 p.m." from N0-S1) and the time the Merrowgate Development Squad sent their email (10:15 a.m. from N3-S1).
- This requires using both selected sentences: N0-S1 supplies the closing time (with the ambiguity that we resolve by assumption), and N3-S1 supplies the exact email time and date. Both are necessary: without N0-S1 we wouldn't know the start time; without N3-S1 we wouldn't know the email time/date.

[Answer derivation]:
Compute duration from 2025-07-12 18:35 to 2025-07-28 10:15.

Method:
- 2025-07-12 18:35 → 2025-07-13 00:00 = 5 hours 25 minutes
- Full days: 2025-07-13 00:00 → 2025-07-28 00:00 = 15 days
- 2025-07-28 00:00 → 2025-07-28 10:15 = 10 hours 15 minutes
- Sum times: 15 days + (5h25m + 10h15m) = 15 days + 15 hours 40 minutes

Total elapsed time = 15 days, 15 hours, 40 minutes.

I reviewed the previous response. Overall it followed the task and computed the duration correctly, but it omitted the required listing and explanation of the sentence IDs used (the output left additional_sentence_ids and additional_sentence_explanation empty). Per the current instructions, those fields should list the selected sentence IDs and explain the unique information each provides and why they're needed. No other substantive corrections are necessary—the assumption and duration calculation are appropriate and correct.

Possible plausible mistakes:
- Counting full days incorrectly: inclusive vs exclusive counting (Jul 12 to Jul 28 could be misread as 16 days instead of 15).
- Misreading "shortly after 6:30 p.m." as 6:45 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. exactly—introduce small-hours difference (e.g., 15 days, 14 hours, 30 minutes or 15 days, 17 hours, 40 minutes).
- Mistaking the email date/time (10:15 a.m.) for PM or another day.
Best distractor: use the common inclusive-day error producing 16 days, 15 hours, 40 minutes. It's realistic (plausible counting error), uses the same sentences, and is clearly incorrect compared to the correct 15 days, 15 hours, 40 minutes.

Potential pairs (must use sentences from different events):
- Pair A: N0-S1 (final session closed shortly after 6:30 p.m. on 2025-07-12) with N4-S1 (reassessment began at approximately 19:10 on 2025-08-04). Both give specific datetimes (one slightly approximate). Can compute elapsed time between the two datetimes.
- Pair B: N0-S1 (2025-07-12 shortly after 18:30) with N4-S9 (physiotherapy monitoring to commence with an 08:15 check on 2025-08-05). Both give specific datetimes; can compute elapsed time.
- Other combinations considered (e.g., N0-S9 "within an hour" vs N4-S5 20:03 on 2025-08-04) are more ambiguous and less precise.

Decision: Include Pair A and Pair B. For calculations I will use 18:30 on 2025-07-12 as the anchor for "shortly after 6:30 p.m." and accept the approximations noted in the source sentences (N4-S1 "approximately 19:10").

<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]

N0-S1:
- Time information: "The final session closed shortly after 6:30 p.m." No exact minute is given.
- Event date: 2025-07-12 (the Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship concluded on 2025-07-12).
Assumptions:
- "Shortly after 6:30 p.m." is not precise. To derive a single absolute point in time we must assume a specific minute. I will assume "shortly after 6:30 p.m." = 6:32 p.m. (18:32). This is a plausible, small offset consistent with "shortly after."
Absolute dates:
- Start point = 2025-07-12 at 18:32 local time (assumed).

N4-S1:
- Time information: "The reassessment began at approximately 19:10 local time, lasted about 25 minutes..." This provides a start time (approximate) and a duration of that reassessment, but for the requested span we only need its start time.
- Event date: 2025-08-04 (the reassessment occurred on the evening of 2025-08-04).
Assumptions:
- "Approximately 19:10" will be treated as 19:10 (19:10:00) for calculation.
Absolute dates:
- End point (reassessment start) = 2025-08-04 at 19:10 local time.

[No additional sentences are required; both selected sentences supply the unique start and end points (with one required assumption on the exact minute of "shortly after 6:30 p.m.").]

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the championship final's close (the "shortly after 6:30 p.m." time on the championship date) and the start of the physiotherapist reassessment that began at ~19:10 on its date. Require the explicit assumption that "shortly after 6:30 p.m." = 6:32 p.m. to make the calculation unique.
- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - N0-S1 supplies the date of the championship and that the final session closed shortly after 6:30 p.m. (this yields the start point when an assumed minute is fixed).
  - N4-S1 supplies the reassessment start time and its date (this yields the end point).
- Framing: The question must not state the dates or times directly; it should instead reference the described events and specify the assumption for the ambiguous "shortly after 6:30 p.m."

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: 2025-07-12 18:32 (assumed).
- End:   2025-08-04 19:10 (given as approximately 19:10).
- Compute difference:
  - From 2025-07-12 18:32 to 2025-08-04 18:32 = 23 days (Jul 13–Aug 4 is 23 days; equivalently July 12→Aug 4 = 23 days).
  - From 2025-08-04 18:32 to 2025-08-04 19:10 = 38 minutes.

N0-S1: Provides the championship final's closing time relative to the championship date ("shortly after 6:30 p.m.") and identifies the event date (the championship concluded on that date). This sentence supplies the start point for the duration (the question requires an explicit assumption to resolve "shortly after").

N4-S1: Provides the reassessment's start time ("began at approximately 19:10") and identifies the reassessment date (the physiotherapist reassessment occurred on that date). This sentence supplies the end point for the duration.

Both sentences are required because N0-S1 gives the (ambiguous) closing time on the championship date and N4-S1 gives the reassessment start time on a later date; together they permit calculation of the elapsed absolute time once the stated assumption is applied.

Possible miscalculations:
- Interpreting "shortly after 6:30 p.m." as exactly 6:30 p.m. gives 18:30 to 19:10 on 2025-08-04 → 23 days, 0 hours, 40 minutes. This is plausible and close to correct (only 2 minutes off), so it's a strong distractor.
- Interpreting "shortly after 6:30 p.m." as 6:35 → 23d 0h 35m (also plausible but less symmetric).
- Using the meet date (2025-07-12) and reassessment date (2025-08-04) but forgetting minutes → 23 days exactly (no minutes) — less plausible because minutes are given.
- Using the championship closing time as 6:32 (correct assumption) but misreading reassessment start as 19:00 → would give 22d 23h 28m — less plausible.

Choose the 23 days, 0 hours, 40 minutes distractor: closely mirrors correct answer, arises from a reasonable alternate interpretation (taking "shortly after 6:30 p.m." as 6:30 p.m. exactly), and uses the same sentences (N0-S1 and N4-S1) to appear credible.

- Event date: 2025-07-12 (the N0 event date).

N4-S9:
- Time information: "Ivo Harlen checked in ... at about 20:30, ... and confirmed by phone ... that physiotherapy monitoring would commence with an 08:15 check on 2025-08-05."
- Event date: 2025-08-04 (the N4 event date). The sentence explicitly gives the scheduled 08:15 check on 2025-08-05.

Assumptions:
- "Shortly after 6:30 p.m." (N0-S1) will be interpreted as 6:32 p.m. (18:32). This is a stated assumption used to derive a precise start time and will be declared in the question.
- "About 20:30" (N4-S9) is not used as an endpoint in the chosen question; the endpoint used is the scheduled physiotherapy check time (08:15 on 2025-08-05) explicitly given in N4-S9.
- All times are local and on the dates given in their respective events.

Absolute dates (derived):

- End point: 2025-08-05 at 08:15 (explicit in N4-S9).

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences are required: N0-S1 provides the start (meet final close) and N4-S9 provides the scheduled physiotherapy check (end).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the meet final session's close (interpreting "shortly after 6:30 p.m." with the stated assumption) and the confirmed physiotherapy monitoring check time the next month (the 08:15 check).
- Unique info required from each sentence:
  - N0-S1: the meet final closed "shortly after 6:30 p.m." and the event date (2025-07-12) anchors that time to a specific date.
  - N4-S9: the scheduled physiotherapy monitoring check time (08:15) on a specific date (2025-08-05).
- Framing the question without explicit dates/times forces extraction of these points from the sentences and application of the stated assumption.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start = 2025-07-12 18:32 (assumption).
- End = 2025-08-05 08:15 (explicit).

Review of previous response against task instructions:

Findings:
- The previous response followed most instructions: it identified time info for both sentences, stated assumptions, derived absolute datetimes, computed the duration correctly, and produced a concise answer in the required format.
- Minor omissions/format issues:
  1. The <results> block omitted any mention of which selected sentence IDs are required to answer the question. The current task's output format asks for "additional_sentence_ids" listing required sentences (including those selected previously), if applicable. It is better to list the two selected sentence IDs (N0-S1 and N4-S9) so it's explicit which sentences are needed.
  2. The "additional_sentence_explanation" field was left empty. The instructions require an explanation of the unique information from each additional sentence if applicable; here we should explain why N0-S1 and N4-S9 are each necessary.
- The numeric assumption (interpreting "shortly after 6:30 p.m." as 6:32 p.m.) was explicitly stated in the question in the previous response. The instructions permit making assumptions but require they be stated; this was done and should be retained.

Corrections to make:
- Add additional_sentence_ids listing N0-S1 and N4-S9.
- Fill additional_sentence_explanation explaining the unique temporal information each sentence supplies and why both are necessary.

No changes to the computed duration are needed; the arithmetic is correct:
- Start: 2025-07-12 18:32 (assumption)
- End: 2025-08-05 08:15 (explicit in N4-S9)
- Difference = 23 days, 13 hours, 43 minutes

I will therefore reproduce the prior question and answer, and add the missing sentence IDs and explanations. Minimal changes only.

<additional_sentence_explanation>N0-S1 supplies the meet final's closing time phrased as "shortly after 6:30 p.m." and anchors that time to the meet event (the relevant event date is 2025-07-12); this sentence is required to derive the start point. N4-S9 supplies the confirmed physiotherapy monitoring check time (08:15) and the explicit date for that check (2025-08-05); this sentence is required to derive the end point. Both sentences are necessary because the start time must be taken from N0-S1 (with the stated assumption) and the end time comes from N4-S9; neither sentence alone suffices to compute the interval.</additional_sentence_explanation>

Goal: produce one plausible but incorrect multiple-choice distractor.
Correct answer is 23 days, 13 hours, 43 minutes (from 2025-07-12 18:32 to 2025-08-05 08:15).

Common misreads that could produce plausible wrong answers:
- Use the Ivo Harlen check-in time (about 20:30 on 2025-08-04) rather than the confirmed 08:15 physio check on 2025-08-05. That yields: from 2025-07-12 18:32 to 2025-08-04 20:30 = 23 days, 1 hour, 58 minutes.
- Use "shortly after 6:30 p.m." as 6:30 instead of 6:32 — tiny difference (2 minutes) gives 23d13h45m (too close to correct; may not be clearly incorrect).
- Use arrival evening (Ivo arrived evening 2025-08-04) vs check time — similar to check-in approach.

Choose the Ivo check-in based distractor because it's clearly incorrect, yet highly plausible (uses exact times cited in outline: meet close and Ivo check-in/arrival lines).
Will include sentence IDs N0-S1, N4-S8, N4-S9 to make it plausible.

Compute distractor value: 23 days, 1 hour, 58 minutes (calculation: July 12 18:32 -> Aug 4 18:32 = 23 days; +1:58 -> 23d 1h 58m).
Provide brief explanation why incorrect (measures to check-in time rather than the physiotherapy monitoring start on Aug 5 08:15).

Potential pairs:
1. N0-S2 (Sera's 200m time 1:59.86) and N0-S7 (second 100m in 59.20) — can subtract the second-100 split from the total 200 time to get the first-100 time (a precise duration).
2. N0-S1 (final session closed shortly after 6:30 p.m.) and N0-S9 (officials posted updated results PDF within an hour) — can derive that the posting occurred within one hour after the session closed (i.e., by about 7:30 p.m. on the event date), giving a meaningful bound on the time span between session close and posting.
3. N0-S0 (event concluded on 2025-07-12) with N0-S9 — possible to interpret posting occurred within an hour of the meet conclusion, but N0-S1 provides a clearer time anchor for the "within an hour" reference.

Decision: include pairs 1 and 2 because they yield clear, meaningful time spans (one exact split duration and one bounded interval tied to a specific clock time).

<explanation>Sentence N0-S2 gives the total 200-meter time (1:59.86) and N0-S7 gives the second 100 meters split (59.20). Subtracting the second-100 split from the total yields the first-100 time: 1:59.86 − 0:59.20 = 0:60.66, i.e., 60.66 seconds (1:00.66) for the first 100 meters — a precise duration between the race start and the 100m mark.</explanation>

<explanation>Sentence N0-S1 states the final session closed shortly after 6:30 p.m. on the event date (2025-07-12). Sentence N0-S9 says officials posted the updated results PDF "within an hour." Interpreting "within an hour" as occurring within one hour after the session closure yields a bounded time span: the posting took place no later than about 7:30 p.m. on 2025-07-12, so the interval between session close (~6:30 p.m.) and the posting is at most 1 hour.</explanation>

<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]
N0-S2:
- Describe the time information from this sentence:
  - Gives Sera Lortin's total 200-meter freestyle time: 1:59.86 (a duration of 119.86 seconds).
- Identify the event date:
  - Event date for the outline: 2025-07-12 (the championship final is described in this sentence and is assumed to have occurred on the event date).
Assumptions:
- The reported total time (1:59.86) is the official time for the same championship final referenced in the outline and is measured in seconds with hundredths precision.
Absolute dates/times:
- Total race duration = 1 minute 59.86 seconds = 119.86 seconds.

N0-S7:
- Describe the time information from this sentence:
  - Gives the second 100 meters split: 59.20 seconds.
- Identify the event date:
  - The split is described as produced "following the final" context; assume it refers to the same race (championship final) on the event date 2025-07-12.
Assumptions:
- The second-100m split (59.20 s) is measured for the same 200m swim whose total time is given in N0-S2.
Absolute dates/times:
- Second 100 m duration = 59.20 seconds.

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences are required. Both selected sentences are necessary: N0-S2 provides total time; N0-S7 provides second-100 split. Neither alone suffices to compute the first-100 or the difference between first and second 100s.

Question Idea:
- Compute the difference in duration between the first 100 m and the second 100 m of the same 200 m swim.
- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - From N0-S2: the total 200 m time (to derive first 100 = total − second 100).
  - From N0-S7: the second 100 m split (directly given).
- Frame the question so it requires both: ask "by how many seconds was the second 100 m faster than the first 100 m?" This forces using total and second-split.

Answer derivation:
- Total 200 m = 1:59.86 = 119.86 seconds (from N0-S2).
- Second 100 m = 59.20 seconds (from N0-S7).
- First 100 m = total − second = 119.86 − 59.20 = 60.66 seconds (1:00.66).
- Difference (first − second) = 60.66 − 59.20 = 1.46 seconds.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The original response correctly identified time information from N0-S2 and N0-S7, made explicit assumptions, computed the first-100 split and the difference, and produced a clear question and concise numeric answer.
- One minor discrepancy: the final output left additional_sentence_ids empty. The task's results block should list the additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, and it was specifically requested in the follow-up to include the selected sentences. The two selected sentences (N0-S2 and N0-S7) are indeed required and should be listed there. Also an explanation of why each is needed should be provided.

Corrections made:
- Added additional_sentence_ids with N0-S2 and N0-S7.

Possible distractor strategies:
- Use the 0.35-second margin mentioned in N0-S3 as a distractor (plausible misreading: confuse lead over second-place with split difference).
- Use the 0.4-second meet-record improvement (N0-S2) as a distractor (could be mistaken for split difference).
- Use the second-100 split itself (59.20) subtracted from 60.00 or some round-number error to create a plausible arithmetic mistake (e.g., 0.80 or 0.46).
- Use combination of record improvement and split (0.4 vs 59.20) -> 0.4 or 0.35 plausible.
Choose one distractor: 0.35 seconds (ties to N0-S3) — very plausible because 0.35 appears in outline; clearly incorrect vs correct 1.46 s; explanation: confuses lead over second-place with split difference.
Include sentence IDs that support plausibility: N0-S2 (total time), N0-S7 (second-100 split), N0-S3 (0.35 lead).

<answer>0.35 seconds</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — this 0.35 value is the margin by which Sera touched the wall ahead of the second-place swimmer (N0-S3), not the difference between her two 100 m splits. Using the reported total (1:59.86) and the second-100 split (59.20) yields a first 100 of 60.66, so the second 100 was 1.46 seconds faster, not 0.35.</explanation>

N0-S1:
- Time information: "The final session closed shortly after 6:30 p.m."
- Event date: 2025-07-12 (from the event header)
Assumptions:
- "Shortly after 6:30 p.m." is interpreted as 6:31 p.m. on the event date (a minimal plausible reading of "shortly after").
Absolute dates:
- Final session close (assumed): 2025-07-12 18:31 (local time)

N0-S9:
- Time information: "Officials posted an updated results PDF to the championship website within an hour and forwarded Sera Lortin's time ... for formal ratification..."
- The phrase "within an hour" does not state the reference point explicitly. Reasonably, it refers to actions taken after the meet's conclusion (the final session). To answer the time-span question using only the selected sentences, we must assume "within an hour" means within 60 minutes after the final session closed.
Assumptions:
- "Within an hour" means at most 60 minutes after the final session closed.
Absolute dates:
- Latest possible posting time (under the assumptions): 2025-07-12 19:31 (i.e., 60 minutes after 18:31)
- Earliest possible posting time (under the assumptions): 2025-07-12 18:31 (immediately at close)

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences are required: N0-S1 supplies the session-close time anchor; N0-S9 supplies the posting-time bound ("within an hour").

Question Idea:
- Ask for the maximum possible time span between the final session closing and the posting of the updated results PDF, given explicit assumptions about "shortly after 6:30 p.m." and "within an hour".
- Unique info required from each sentence:
  - N0-S1: provides the start point ("shortly after 6:30 p.m." on the event date).
  - N0-S9: provides the upper bound on the delay ("within an hour") for posting the PDF.
- Framing: State the assumptions explicitly in the question so the solver knows how to convert "shortly after" and "within an hour" into absolute times.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start (assumed): 2025-07-12 18:31
- Latest posting (given "within an hour"): 2025-07-12 19:31

Problems found:
1. The original response's <results> left additional_sentence_ids empty. The task requires listing any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (and at minimum the selected sentences should be referenced as required). The selected sentences were N0-S1 and N0-S9, so they should be listed.
2. The question included an explicit absolute time "6:31 p.m." in the assumption. The instructions prefer avoiding absolute times in the question if possible; it's better to express the assumption as "1 minute after" to avoid repeating an explicit clock time while still stating the assumption.
3. The scratchpad in the original response already computed absolute dates including the event date; that's fine. But the final question should not include absolute dates. The original question included an assumption that did include an absolute time; we'll change that to "1 minute after" to comply with guidance to avoid absolute times in the question when possible.

Corrections made:
- Rewrote the question to replace "6:31 p.m." with "1 minute after 6:30 p.m." (expressed as "1 minute later") so the question avoids an explicit clock time while still stating the necessary assumption.
- Added the selected sentence IDs (N0-S1 and N0-S9) to additional_sentence_ids.
- Added an explanation of why each sentence is required in additional_sentence_explanation.
- Kept the computed answer the same (60 minutes) and preserved the assumptions in the scratchpad implicitly (the answer derivation remains unchanged).

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for maximum possible timespan between final session closing and posting updated results. Correct is 60 minutes. Need a distractor that seems realistic but is clearly wrong.

Possible distractors:
- 59 minutes — plausible if reader interprets "shortly after 6:30 p.m." as 6:31 and "within an hour" as before 7:30 p.m.; interval = 59 minutes. Clearly incorrect because the question defines "within an hour" as at most 60 minutes so maximum is 60, not 59.
- 31 minutes — less plausible; arbitrary.
- 90 minutes or 61 minutes — contradicts "within an hour" so less plausible.
- 0 minutes — implausible.

Choose 59 minutes: it's challenging (off-by-one minute) and uses same sentences N0-S1 and N0-S9 to justify plausibility. Provide brief explanation why incorrect: because "within an hour" allows up to 60 minutes, so maximum is 60, not 59. Include sentence IDs N0-S1,N0-S9.

Reference to "45-minute evaluation" ties the question to N2-S0 so that both sentences are needed; reference to "federation's formal ratification" ties to N1-S0.

Goal: Create one plausible but incorrect distractor for "How many days elapsed between ratification (2025-07-16) and evaluation completion (2025-07-22)?" Correct = 6 days.

Common miscounts:
- Inclusive counting (16→22 inclusive) = 7 days — plausible error.
- Off-by-one subtraction (22 - 16 = 6) is correct; but some might think 5 if they count nights or partial days.
- Week assumption: "one week" -> 7 days.

Choose 7 days as distractor — it's a believable and common mistake (counting both start and end dates). Use outline sentences N1-S0 and N2-S0 to make it plausible. Provide brief explanation why incorrect: actual elapsed is 6 days; inclusive counting yields 7 which is wrong per given dates.

Keep explanation concise and reference sentence IDs for plausibility.

<explanation>This is incorrect because the ratification was on 2025-07-16 and the evaluation completed on 2025-07-22, which is a 6-day span; the 7-day answer reflects an inclusive counting error (counting both the 16th and 22nd).</explanation>

N2-S1:
- Time information: "The evaluation began at 10:00 a.m. and concluded at 10:45 a.m."
- Event date: 2025-07-22 (this sentence is within the event dated 2025-07-22).
Assumptions:
- The "concluded at 10:45 a.m." refers to 10:45 a.m. on 2025-07-22 (the event date).
Absolute dates:
- Evaluation end: 2025-07-22 at 10:45 a.m.

N1-S9:
- Time information: "the selection committee intends to review Nadia Varnell's written evaluation within 72 hours..."
- Event date: 2025-07-16 (this sentence is within the event dated 2025-07-16).
Assumptions:
- The phrase "review Nadia Varnell's written evaluation within 72 hours" means the committee will complete its review within 72 hours after the written evaluation is available/submitted.
- Nadia Varnell's written evaluation is the one produced following the evaluation that concluded on 2025-07-22 (so the 72-hour review window starts at or immediately after the evaluation's completion on 2025-07-22 10:45 a.m.). This is a necessary and plausible assumption because N1-S9 commits to a 72-hour review of Nadia's written evaluation and N2-S1 establishes when that evaluation occurred.
Absolute dates:
- Review deadline (72 hours after evaluation end): 2025-07-25 at 10:45 a.m. (i.e., 3 days or 72 hours after 2025-07-22 10:45 a.m.)

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences are required: N2-S1 supplies the precise end time of the evaluation; N1-S9 supplies the 72-hour review window length that defines the deadline. Without N2-S1 you lack the starting timestamp; without N1-S9 you lack the review window length.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the duration between the evaluation's end and the latest time by which the selection committee intended to complete its review. This requires knowing the evaluation end time (N2-S1) and the 72-hour review window (N1-S9).

[Answer derivation]:
- Evaluation end = 2025-07-22 10:45 a.m. (from N2-S1).
- Latest review completion = evaluation end + 72 hours = 2025-07-25 10:45 a.m. (from N1-S9 interpreted as 72 hours after the evaluation).
- Duration between these two points = 72 hours = 3 days.

Issues found:
- The original response omitted listing the selected sentence IDs in <additional_sentence_ids>. The task requires listing any additional sentence IDs used; here both originally selected sentences (N2-S1 and N1-S9) are necessary and should be listed.
- The task instructions require that any assumptions made must be clearly stated in the question. The original question did not state the assumption that the 72-hour review window begins at the evaluation's completion time. That assumption was present in the scratchpad but not in the question itself.
- The rest of the original derivation and answer are correct: evaluation concluded at 10:45 a.m. on the evaluation date and the review window is 72 hours, so the interval is 72 hours (3 days).

Corrections made:
- Added the explicit assumption into the question text so the question clearly states the necessary assumption.
- Included the two required sentence IDs (N2-S1 and N1-S9) in <additional_sentence_ids>.

Possible plausible incorrect timings drawn from outline:
- 48 hours (Merrowgate said they'd forward confirmation within 48 hours in N2-S7) — very plausible confusion.
- 14 days (remittance notification window in N1-S3) — less plausible for review period.
- 45 minutes (length of the evaluation N2-S0/N2-S1) — could be misread as review window but unlikely.
- 3 days already correct; avoid.

Best distractor: 48 hours (2 days) because it's directly in the outline and could be mistaken as the selection committee's timeline. Use supporting sentences: N2-S7 (48 hours), N2-S1 (evaluation conclusion time), and N1-S9 (selection committee review within 72 hours) — include N1-S9 to show contrast making it plausible but incorrect.

Keep explanation concise: state why incorrect and reference that 48 hours relates to Merrowgate's confirmation, not committee review.

- Other candidates considered (e.g., using N3-S1's "first materialized after ... 2025-07-25" with N3-S0's notification 2025-07-28) were not chosen because both sentences come from the same event; requirement is sentences must be from different events.

N1-S4:
- Time information: Specifies a scheduled one-on-one evaluation for Sera Lortin and Nadia Varnell on 2025-07-22.
- Event date: The containing event has date 2025-07-16, but the sentence itself gives an absolute date (2025-07-22).

N3-S6:
- Time information: States that Merrowgate Development Squad will submit Sera Lortin's medical clearance and arrival information "by 2025-07-30."
- Event date: The containing event has date 2025-07-28, but the sentence itself includes an absolute deadline date (2025-07-30).

Assumptions:
- Interpret both given calendar dates as local calendar dates (no time-of-day details needed).
- Compute the time span as the difference in calendar days from the date of the evaluation (start point) to the deadline date (end point). No inclusive/exclusive ambiguity: use standard elapsed-days difference (end date minus start date).

Absolute dates:
- Evaluation date (start): 2025-07-22 (from N1-S4).
- Submission deadline (end): 2025-07-30 (from N3-S6).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed number of days between the scheduled one-on-one evaluation (the date given in one sentence) and the deadline for submitting medical clearance/arrival info (the date given in the other sentence). 
- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - From N1-S4: the evaluation date (start point).
  - From N3-S6: the submission deadline date (end point).
- Framing the question without dates forces the solver to extract those two dates from the two sentences and compute the elapsed days.

I reviewed the previous response and compared it to the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly extracted absolute dates from both selected sentences (2025-07-22 and 2025-07-30), stated assumptions, computed the elapsed time as 8 days, and framed a question that requires both sentences to answer.
- The answer ("8 days") follows the instruction to be concise and not a full sentence.
- One minor omission: the earlier response left the <additional_sentence_ids> empty even though the question depends on the two selected sentences (N1-S4 and N3-S6). The instructions request listing additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected previously), if applicable. To be explicit and fully compliant, I will include those sentence IDs and a short explanation of the unique information each provides.

No other corrections are necessary.

Possible incorrect answers: 7 days, 6 days, 13 days, 14 days, 12 days. Need to pick one distractor only.

Choose a distractor that is plausible and ties to other dates in the outline so it seems reasonable. The outline includes:
- Evaluation scheduled 2025-07-22 (N1-S4).
- Deadline to submit medical clearance by 2025-07-30 (N3-S6) — correct 8 days.
- Merrowgate provisional arrival evening 2025-08-04 (N3-S7).
- Clinic runs 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 (N2-S8).

A plausible confusion: counting to the provisional arrival date (2025-08-04) instead of the submission deadline gives 13 days between 2025-07-22 and 2025-08-04. That leverages real dates in the outline so it's believable.

Make distractor = "13 days". Provide explanation why it's incorrect (deadline was 2025-07-30, not arrival 2025-08-04) and list sentence IDs that make it plausible: N1-S4 (evaluation date), N3-S7 (provisional arrival 2025-08-04), N2-S8 (clinic dates starting 2025-08-05).

- Time information: "placed a provisional hold on the clinic classroom for the 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 period ..."
- Event date: The sentence itself gives the specific period 2025-08-05 through 2025-08-18.

Assumptions:
- Treat all given dates as calendar dates in the same timezone with no partial-day times; use whole-day resolution.
- Interpret the "start" of the provisional hold as the calendar date 2025-08-05.
- Interpret the ratification moment as occurring on the calendar date 2025-07-16.

- Total elapsed days = 15 + 5 = 20 days.

Question Idea:

Possible mistaken intervals to use:
- 2025-07-16 to 2025-07-28 = 12 days (plausible confusion because multiple items dated 7/28 about medical notice and classroom reservation request).
- 2025-07-16 to 2025-07-22 = 6 days (evaluation date) — too small and maybe obviously wrong.
- 2025-07-16 to 2025-07-30 = 14 days (Ivo said they'd submit clearance by 7/30) — plausible but 7/30 is a deadline, not hold start.
- 2025-07-16 to 2025-08-05 = 20 days (correct).
Best distractor: 12 days, because reader might confuse the 7/28 Merrowgate notification (N3-S0/N3-S1) or Carterline's classroom reservation request (N3-S8) with the Brindemoor provisional hold (N3-S9). Use sentence IDs N1-S0, N3-S0, N3-S8 to support plausibility.

N1-S4:
- Time information: Explicit calendar date given for the scheduled evaluation: 2025-07-22. No time-of-day is specified.
- Event date: The parent event is dated 2025-07-16, but the sentence itself gives the scheduled date 2025-07-22 (a later date).
Assumptions:
- Because no time-of-day is provided for the scheduled evaluation date, I will assume the point in time representing that scheduled day is the start of that calendar day (00:00 local time on 2025-07-22). This assumption will be stated in the question so the duration is unambiguous.
Absolute dates:
- Start point (assumed): 2025-07-22 00:00 (local)

N4-S9:
- Time information: Ivo Harlen checked in at about 20:30 on 2025-08-04 (explicit), and he confirmed by phone that physiotherapy monitoring would commence with an 08:15 check on 2025-08-05 (explicit).
- Event date: Parent event is dated 2025-08-04; the sentence gives times on 2025-08-04 and 2025-08-05.
Assumptions:
- Use the explicit times as given: 08:15 on 2025-08-05 is the target time. The check-in time (about 20:30 on 2025-08-04) is also explicit but not needed if we compare to the scheduled evaluation date; however it is part of the same sentence and supports the 08:15 on 2025-08-05.
Absolute dates:
- End point: 2025-08-05 08:15 (local)

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences provide unique needed information: N1-S4 supplies the scheduled evaluation date (2025-07-22) and N4-S9 supplies the morning physiotherapy start (08:15 on 2025-08-05). Both are required to compute the span.

Question Idea:
- Ask: "Assuming the scheduled evaluation's day begins at 00:00 local time, how much time elapsed between the start of the scheduled one-on-one evaluation day and the confirmed first morning physiotherapy check?"
- Unique information required:
  - From N1-S4: the calendar date of the scheduled evaluation (2025-07-22). Without it, the start date is unknown.
  - From N4-S9: the exact time and date of the first physiotherapy check (08:15 on 2025-08-05). Without it, the end point is unknown.
- This phrasing avoids stating absolute dates/times in the question, but requires extracting them from the two sentences and applying the stated assumption.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: 2025-07-22 00:00 (assumed)
- End:   2025-08-05 08:15
Compute difference:
- From 2025-07-22 00:00 to 2025-08-05 00:00 = 14 days

- Inclusive counting of both start and end dates -> adds one extra day -> 15 days, 8 hours, 15 minutes.
- Misreading evaluation start as 10:00 a.m. on 7/22 (but question uses calendar day start 00:00) -> could produce 14 days, 22 hours, 15 minutes (but that's close and might confuse).
- Confusing clinic start evening 2025-08-04 at 20:30 (Ivo arrival) with physio check -> could produce 13 days, 11 hours, 45 minutes etc.

Pick a distractor that is simple, plausible, and clearly wrong: "15 days, 8 hours, 15 minutes" is good — plausible if someone counts inclusively. Use sentences N1-S4 (scheduled evaluation date) and N4-S9 (physio check time/date) to make plausible.

Create explanation: it's incorrect because the correct count excludes inclusive double-count; actual elapsed days are 14, not 15. Provide sentence IDs for plausibility.

N1-S1:
- Time information: States the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation updated its database to record the 1:59.86 time "as effective 2025-07-16."
- Event date: The parent event date is 2025-07-16 (matches the explicit date in the sentence).

Assumptions:
- The phrase "effective 2025-07-16" identifies the exact start point: 2025-07-16 (calendar date).
Absolute dates:
- Start date = 2025-07-16.

N4-S4:
- Time information: States Merrowgate forwarded Rowan Myles's written medical clearance "by email on the evening of 2025-08-04" and explains it was sent same-day after the reassessment on 2025-08-04.
- Event date: The parent event date is 2025-08-04 (matches the explicit date and "evening of 2025-08-04").

Assumptions:
- "Evening of 2025-08-04" indicates the clearance email was sent on the calendar date 2025-08-04 (use that as the exact end point).
Absolute dates:
- End date = 2025-08-04.

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentence is needed; both selected sentences supply explicit calendar dates for the two points in time.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the number of days elapsed between the Federation's effective recording date for the ratified performance (from N1-S1) and the date Merrowgate forwarded the written medical clearance by email to the Federation (from N4-S4).
- Unique required info:
  - From N1-S1: the effective date used by the Federation (start point).
  - From N4-S4: the date the clearance was forwarded by Merrowgate (end point).
- Framing the question without dates ensures the solver must extract those dates from the two sentences.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start = 2025-07-16
- End = 2025-08-04
Compute days between:
- Days remaining in July after (and excluding) 16 July: 31 - 16 = 15 days (from 17 Jul through 31 Jul).
- Days in August up to and including 4 Aug: 4 days (1 Aug through 4 Aug).
- Total elapsed days = 15 + 4 = 19 days.

Note on counting convention:
- This counts full calendar days elapsed from the start date (2025-07-16) to the end date (2025-08-04). The calculation treats the difference as EndDate - StartDate in days, yielding 19 days.

Review summary:
- The original response correctly identified the two absolute dates from the selected sentences:
  - N1-S1 gives the Federation's effective record date: 2025-07-16.
  - N4-S4 gives the clearance-forwarding date: 2025-08-04.
- The elapsed-days computation (EndDate - StartDate = 19 days) is correct when counting full calendar days between the two dates and excluding the start date (i.e., treating the interval as 2025-07-16 -> 2025-08-04 = 19 days).
- The original question avoided explicit dates and required extracting dates from the selected sentences, as required.

Problems found:
1. The previous output left <additional_sentence_ids> empty and provided no <additional_sentence_explanation>. The task requested listing additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected previously) and explaining their unique information if applicable. Even if no new sentences are needed, the selected sentences used must be listed.
2. The scratchpad in the original response contained the derivation and assumptions, which is good, but the final results section omitted explicit reference to the selected sentence IDs used to answer the question.

Corrections made:
- Added the two selected sentence IDs (N1-S1 and N4-S4) in <additional_sentence_ids>.
- Added <additional_sentence_explanation> describing what unique temporal information each sentence provides and why each is needed.
- Kept the question and numeric answer unchanged.
- Reiterated the counting assumption (difference excludes the start date) in the scratchpad.

Assumptions retained and clarified:
- Use calendar-date values given in the selected sentences as the exact points in time: start = 2025-07-16 (effective date), end = 2025-08-04 (evening the clearance was emailed).
- Count elapsed full calendar days as EndDate - StartDate (excluding the start date), yielding 19 days. If counted inclusively, the interval would be 20 days; the response uses the standard exclusive-start day difference.

Conclusion:
- The question and answer remain valid and require both selected sentences to be answered. The only substantive fix was to list and explain the selected sentence IDs in the results section.

Possible confusion points:
- Federation effective date 2025-07-16 (N1-S1).
- Merrowgate initially aimed to submit clearance by 2025-07-30 (N3-S6) — many readers might compute to that date instead of the actual forwarding date.
- Actual forwarding occurred 2025-08-04 (N4-S4) — correct difference is 19 days.
Good distractor: 14 days (difference between 2025-07-16 and the aimed submission date 2025-07-30). It's plausible and uses real dates from the outline, but is incorrect because the clearance was actually sent on 2025-08-04.

N1-S0:
- Time information: Explicit absolute date given — the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation formally ratified Sera Lortin's time on 2025-07-16.
- Event date: The enclosing event date is 2025-07-16 (matches the sentence's explicit date).

Assumptions:
- The ratification action occurred on the date stated (2025-07-16) and that date is the appropriate anchor for subsequent relative time statements in the same event.

Absolute dates:
- Ratification (start point) = 2025-07-16.

N1-S3:
- Time information: Relative timeframe: "a remittance notification will be issued to Sera Lortin within 14 days."
- Event date: The sentence is part of the event dated 2025-07-16, so the relative "within 14 days" must be anchored to an earlier absolute point in the event (we assume the most relevant anchor is the ratification date given in N1-S0).

Assumptions:
- "Within 14 days" is counted from the ratification date (2025-07-16). (This is the explicit assumption required because the sentence does not itself state the starting point for the 14-day window.)
- "Within 14 days" means at most 14 calendar days after the start date; the latest possible issuance date is therefore 14 days later.

Absolute dates:
- Latest possible remittance-notification issuance (end point) = 2025-07-16 + 14 days = 2025-07-30.

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences are required: N1-S0 provides the absolute start date; N1-S3 provides the 14-day window that defines the latest possible end date.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the maximum length of time that could elapse between the federation's formal ratification event and the latest possible issuance of the remittance notification, while explicitly stating the necessary assumption that the 14-day window is counted from the ratification date. This requires using N1-S0 to get the start date and N1-S3 to get the relative 14-day limit — both are necessary.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start = ratification date = 2025-07-16 (from N1-S0).
- Latest issuance = within 14 days after start = 2025-07-30 (from N1-S3 assumption).
- Duration = 2025-07-30 − 2025-07-16 = 14 days.

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified absolute dates and assumptions: ratification on 2025-07-16 (N1-S0) and "within 14 days" (N1-S3) anchored to that date.
- The scratchpad included the required derivation and explicit assumptions.
- The generated question does not include absolute dates and requires combining both selected sentences to answer (N1-S0 provides the start date; N1-S3 provides the 14-day window). Therefore the question can only be answered when both selected sentences are present.
- The answer is concise ("14 days") and is a plain time span, as required.
- No additional sentences were needed; the additional_sentence_ids field is correctly empty.

Minor consideration (not an error):
- The "additional_sentence_ids" field could be misread as expecting the two originally selected IDs, but the instructions state to list any additional sentence IDs required beyond the selected ones. Leaving it empty is consistent with the earlier response.

Conclusion:
- No substantive corrections are needed. I will reproduce the original question and answer in the requested output format, retaining the explicit assumption stated in the question.

N1-S4:
- Time information: A one-on-one evaluation is scheduled "for 2025-07-22."
- Event date: The event containing this sentence has an event date of 2025-07-16, but the sentence itself gives an absolute future date (2025-07-22) for the evaluation.
Assumptions:
- Take the sentence at face value: the evaluation is scheduled on the calendar date 2025-07-22 (no specific clock time given).

Absolute dates:
- Evaluation date: 2025-07-22 (assumed to occur at some time during that calendar day).

N1-S9:
- Time information: The selection committee "intends to review Nadia Varnell's written evaluation within 72 hours." The sentence does not state the exact reference moment that starts the 72-hour window.
- Event date: same event block (event date 2025-07-16) but this sentence gives only a relative interval (72 hours) and no explicit start date.
Assumptions:
- The natural reading combined with N1-S4 is that Nadia Varnell's written evaluation will be produced in connection with the one-on-one evaluation on 2025-07-22, and the selection committee's 72-hour review window applies starting on that written evaluation's availability (assumed to be the same day, 2025-07-22).
- Therefore the latest intended review-completion date is 72 hours after 2025-07-22.
Absolute dates:
- Latest intended review completion: 2025-07-22 + 72 hours = 2025-07-25 (same clock time, three calendar days later).
- Equivalent duration between the evaluation (2025-07-22) and the latest intended review completion: 72 hours = 3 days.

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences are required: N1-S4 supplies the evaluation date; N1-S9 supplies the 72-hour review window. Removing either would prevent computing the absolute duration between the evaluation and the review deadline.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the duration between the scheduled one-on-one evaluation and the maximum amount of time the selection committee intends to take to review Nadia Varnell's written evaluation. This requires (a) extracting the evaluation date from one sentence and (b) applying the 72-hour review window from the other sentence to compute the span. The question must not include explicit dates so that the solver must extract them from the selected sentences.

- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - From N1-S4: the date of the scheduled one-on-one evaluation (2025-07-22).
  - From N1-S9: the selection committee's planned review window ("within 72 hours"), which defines the maximum allowed review time after the evaluation/written evaluation.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start point: one-on-one evaluation scheduled on 2025-07-22 (from N1-S4).
- End point (latest intended review completion): within 72 hours after Nadia Varnell's written evaluation, assumed available the same day as the evaluation → 2025-07-22 + 72 hours = 2025-07-25.

However, it did not include the selected sentence IDs in the <additional_sentence_ids> field of the results. The task required listing any additional sentence IDs if applicable; since the question depends on the two selected sentences, those IDs should be listed.
- The task instructions also require that if any assumptions are needed to derive absolute dates, those assumptions must be stated in the question. The previous question did not state the assumption that Nadia Varnell's written evaluation is made available on the same day as the scheduled one-on-one evaluation (which was explicitly noted in the scratchpad as an assumption). That assumption is necessary to link the 72-hour review window to the 2025-07-22 evaluation date and must be included in the question.

Goal: produce one plausible but incorrect distractor. The correct answer is 3 days (72 hours). Good distractor should reference another time period mentioned in the outline to seem believable. Candidate misleading times:
- 14 days (remittance notification to Sera Lortin mentioned in N1-S3) — plausible confusion between remittance timing and selection review.
- 45 minutes (duration of evaluation in N1-S5) — less plausible as "maximum time span to review" but could mislead.
- Same day / 0 hours — could be tempting but less supported by outline.
Choose 14 days as distractor because it's an actual time in the outline and easily conflated with committee timing. Provide explanation clarifying that 14 days refers to remittance notification, not selection committee review. Use N1-S3 as supporting sentence ID for plausibility.

N2-S0:
- Time information: States that "On 2025-07-22 Nadia Varnell completed the scheduled 45-minute evaluation of Sera Lortin..."
- Event date: 2025-07-22
Assumptions:
- The sentence explicitly gives the completion date as 2025-07-22. No time-of-day is provided; only the date is needed for the planned calculation.
Absolute dates:
- Evaluation completion = 2025-07-22 (completion date given directly in the sentence).

N3-S1:
- Time information: Mentions a 10:15 a.m. email (sent as part of the 2025-07-28 event) that described the issue as "minor left-shoulder tenderness that first materialized after a timed interval set on 2025-07-25" and has been managed...
- Event date: 2025-07-28 (the event containing this sentence)
Assumptions:
- The key temporal fact needed is the date when the shoulder tenderness first materialized. The sentence states it "first materialized ... on 2025-07-25" (i.e., after a timed interval set on that date). We therefore take the date of first materialization as 2025-07-25.
- The 10:15 a.m. email time and the email's sending date (which would be within the 2025-07-28 event) are not required for the requested duration.
Absolute dates:
- Shoulder tenderness first materialized = 2025-07-25 (date explicitly referenced in the sentence).

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences are required. Both selected sentences supply the two distinct dates needed (evaluation completion on 2025-07-22 and tenderness onset on 2025-07-25).

Question Idea:
- Ask for elapsed time between the completion of the scheduled 45-minute evaluation and the date when the shoulder tenderness first appeared. This requires:
  - From N2-S0: the completion date of the evaluation (2025-07-22).
  - From N3-S1: the date the tenderness first materialized (2025-07-25).
- Framing the question without mentioning the actual dates forces the solver to extract the dates from the two sentences.

[Answer derivation]:
- Evaluation completion = 2025-07-22 (from N2-S0).
- Tenderness first materialized = 2025-07-25 (from N3-S1).
- Elapsed time = 2025-07-25 − 2025-07-22 = 3 days.

Issues found:
- The original response correctly computed the duration (3 days) and used both selected sentences. However, it did not include the selected sentence IDs in the <additional_sentence_ids> field in the final <results>, which makes it unclear which sentences are required.
- The task instructions require that if assumptions are necessary, they should be stated clearly in the question. The original question did not state the assumption that "first materialized after a timed interval set on 2025-07-25" is to be interpreted as the tenderness first appearing on 2025-07-25. Although the scratchpad noted this assumption, the question itself lacked that explicit assumption statement. The instructions also say to avoid including absolute dates in the question; therefore the assumption should be phrased without explicitly repeating the date.

- Revised the question to explicitly state the necessary assumption (phrased without stating the absolute date) that the phrase "first materialized after a timed interval set on [the interval date referenced in the email]" should be taken to mean the tenderness first appeared on the date of that timed interval. This makes clear the interpretation needed to compute the exact elapsed days, while still requiring the solver to extract the dates from the sentences.
- Kept the computed answer unchanged (3 days) since the original calculation was correct.

<question>Assuming that the phrase "first materialized after a timed interval set on [the interval date referenced in the notification]" is to be interpreted as the tenderness first appearing on that interval date, how many days elapsed between the completion of Nadia Varnell's scheduled 45-minute evaluation of Sera Lortin and the date when Sera Lortin's left-shoulder tenderness first materialized after that timed interval?</question>
<answer>3 days</answer>
<additional_sentence_ids>[N2-S0, N3-S1]</additional_sentence_ids>
<additional_sentence_explanation>N2-S0 provides the completion date of the scheduled 45-minute evaluation (the evaluation completion date). N3-S1 provides the information that the left-shoulder tenderness first materialized after a timed interval set on a specific interval date (the interval date when the tenderness first appeared). Both are required: N2-S0 supplies the earlier time point (evaluation completion) and N3-S1 supplies the later time point (tenderness onset). The stated assumption clarifies that "after a timed interval set on [the interval date]" should be taken to mean the tenderness first appeared on that interval date, enabling an exact day-count between the two dates.</additional_sentence_explanation>

Goal: produce one plausible but incorrect distractor for "how many days elapsed between 2025-07-22 and 2025-07-25" (correct = 3 days). Common miscounts: 2 days (if someone counts only full days in between or mistakenly counts 23–25 as 2), 4 days (if inclusive counting 22–25), 1 day (unlikely), 5 days (not plausible). The most plausible single distractor is 2 days or 4 days. Use outline sentences N2-S0 and N3-S1 to make plausible. Choose "2 days" as distractor — plausible because of off-by-one error or thinking interval date two days after. Provide brief explanation why incorrect (actual difference is 3 days) and cite N2-S0 and N3-S1 as making it plausible.

N2-S8:
- Time information: The sentence gives the scheduled clinic period: it "run from 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18."
- Event date: The event containing this sentence is dated 2025-07-22 (this is the latest possible date for items within that event).
Assumptions:
- The sentence itself supplies absolute start and end dates for the clinic, so we take 2025-08-05 as the clinic start date (a known absolute date).
Absolute dates:
- Clinic start: 2025-08-05
- Clinic end: 2025-08-18

N3-S6:
- Time information: The sentence states Merrowgate Development Squad will submit the medical clearance and arrival information "by 2025-07-30."
- Event date: The event containing this sentence is dated 2025-07-28 (this is the latest possible date for items within that event).
Assumptions:
- "By 2025-07-30" is interpreted as a deadline on 2025-07-30 (an absolute date). We assume the relevant point in time for the submission is the deadline date 2025-07-30 (not an earlier unspecified time on that date).
Absolute dates:
- Submission deadline: 2025-07-30

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences already provide the two absolute dates needed (submission deadline 2025-07-30 and clinic start 2025-08-05).

Question Idea:
- Compute the number of days between the submission deadline (the date by which Merrowgate must submit medical clearance and arrival information) and the scheduled start of the two-week clinic. This requires extracting the deadline date from N3-S6 and the clinic start date from N2-S8; both sentences are necessary.
- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - From N3-S6: the absolute deadline date for submission ("by 2025-07-30").
  - From N2-S8: the clinic start date ("run from 2025-08-05 ...").
- Framing the question without stating dates: ask "How many days are there between the deadline for submitting medical clearance and arrival information and the start of the two-week regional skills clinic?"

[Answer derivation]:
- Submission deadline: 2025-07-30
- Clinic start: 2025-08-05
- Compute the difference in calendar days:
  - July 30 → July 31 = 1 day
  - July 31 → Aug 1 = 1 day (cumulative 2)
  - Aug 1 → Aug 2 = 1 day (3)
  - Aug 2 → Aug 3 = 1 day (4)
  - Aug 3 → Aug 4 = 1 day (5)
  - Aug 4 → Aug 5 = 1 day (6)
- Total = 6 days

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The original question correctly avoided stating absolute dates and required both selected sentences to answer.
- The derivation and computed duration (6 days) are correct: submission deadline 2025-07-30 to clinic start 2025-08-05 = 6 days.
- All required assumptions were stated (treat "by 2025-07-30" as the deadline date).
- The question can only be answered using both selected sentences, and neither sentence alone suffices.

Minor correction:
- The prior <results> left additional_sentence_ids empty. The instructions ask to list additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, "including those selected in the previous response, if applicable." For clarity and completeness I will list the two originally selected sentence IDs (N2-S8 and N3-S6) and explain the unique information each supplies.

No other changes to question or answer content are needed.

Possible confusions to exploit:
- There are multiple dates in outline related to logistics: N2-S9 asks for arrival time etc. by 2025-07-28; N3-S6 says Merrowgate will submit clearance by 2025-07-30. Clinic starts 2025-08-05 (N2-S8). People might use July 28 instead of July 30 when calculating days to Aug 5, giving 8 days. That's plausible and ties to N2-S9.
- Another plausible distractor could be 5 days (if someone uses arrival evening 2025-08-04 from N3-S7 vs July 30), but the July 28 → Aug 5 confusion (8 days) seems stronger because N2-S9 explicitly requests info by July 28.
- We need one distractor only. Choose "8 days" based on July 28 → Aug 5. Make explanation: incorrect because the actual submission deadline given by Merrowgate is July 30 (N3-S6). Plausible sentence IDs supporting the distractor: N2-S8 (clinic start Aug 5) and N2-S9 (request by July 28).

<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]
N2-S1:
- Time information: "The evaluation began at 10:00 a.m. and concluded at 10:45 a.m."
- Event date: 2025-07-22 (from the event containing N2-S1)
Assumptions:
- The times given (10:00 and 10:45) refer to local time on the event date 2025-07-22.
Absolute dates:
- Evaluation start: 2025-07-22 10:00
- Evaluation end: 2025-07-22 10:45

N4-S1:
- Time information: "The reassessment began at approximately 19:10 local time, lasted about 25 minutes..."
- Event date: 2025-08-04 (from the event containing N4-S1)
Assumptions:
- "Approximately 19:10" may be treated as 19:10 exact for computing a precise span (this assumption will be stated explicitly in the question).
- The reassessment start refers to local time on the event date 2025-08-04.
Absolute dates:
- Reassessment start (assumed exact): 2025-08-04 19:10
- Reassessment end (not needed for chosen span, but derivable): 2025-08-04 19:35 (19:10 + 25 minutes)

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences supply the unique times/dates needed: N2-S1 provides the precise end time of the evaluation; N4-S1 provides the (approximate) start time of the reassessment and its event date. Both are required to compute the interval between the evaluation's end and the reassessment's start.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the end of Nadia Varnell's evaluation (uses N2-S1) and the start of Rowan Myles's reassessment (uses N4-S1). This requires extracting the end time/date from N2-S1 and the start time/date from N4-S1; both sentences are necessary and neither can be replaced by other sentences in the outline.
- Frame the question without mentioning absolute calendar dates; instead, instruct to assume each activity occurred on its sentence's event date and to treat "approximately 19:10" as 19:10 exactly (an explicit assumption).

[Answer derivation]:
- Evaluation end = 2025-07-22 10:45
- Reassessment start = 2025-08-04 19:10
Compute interval from 2025-07-22 10:45 to 2025-08-04 19:10.
1) Days from 2025-07-22 10:45 to 2025-08-04 10:45 = 13 days
2) Time from 2025-08-04 10:45 to 2025-08-04 19:10 = 8 hours 25 minutes
Total = 13 days + 8 hours 25 minutes = 13 days, 8 hours, 25 minutes
Alternative expressions: 320 hours, 25 minutes (since 13*24 = 312; 312+8 = 320 hours) or 19,225 minutes (320*60 + 25 = 19,200 + 25 = 19,225).
Assumptions reiterated for the answer:
- Use event dates for each sentence (N2-S1 → 2025-07-22; N4-S1 → 2025-08-04).
- Treat "approximately 19:10" as exactly 19:10.

Review summary:
- The original response correctly identified the absolute times from N2-S1 (2025-07-22 10:45) and N4-S1 (assumed 2025-08-04 19:10), computed the elapsed interval as 13 days, 8 hours, 25 minutes, and phrased a question that does not state absolute dates but requires extracting them. The time calculation is correct.
- One minor discrepancy with the original response: the <additional_sentence_ids> and <additional_sentence_explanation> fields were left empty, but the instructions for this verification step ask to list the selected sentence IDs (and explain their unique information) if applicable. Those fields should list the two selected sentences and explain why each is required.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor. Use common misreading: take evaluation start time (10:00) instead of conclusion (10:45) — yields larger interval: from 2025-07-22 10:00 to 2025-08-04 19:10 = 13 days, 9 hours, 10 minutes. This is believable because N2-S1 includes "began at 10:00 a.m." and N4-S1 gives 19:10. Must explain why incorrect: wrong start time used. Include sentence IDs N2-S1 and N4-S1 to show plausibility.

Possible error patterns readers might make:
- Misread the email time 20:03 as 22:03 (2-hour add) → 13 days, 11 hours, 18 minutes
- Misread the evaluation end as 08:45 (2-hour subtract) → 13 days, 11 hours, 18 minutes but opposite sign (not good)
- Mistake days count by using July 31 vs Aug 4 (off by 1–2 days) → 12 or 14 days variants
- Mistake minutes (e.g., 20:21 vs 20:03) → small minute offsets
Choose one plausible but clearly incorrect distractor: 13 days, 11 hours, 18 minutes — plausible if someone misreads 20:03 as 22:03 or miscomputes hour difference; still clearly wrong because correct is 9 hours 18 minutes.
Use supporting sentences to make distractor seem plausible: N2-S1 (10:45 end), N4-S5 (20:03 email time), N2-S0 or N4-S4 could support dates but N2-S1 and N4-S5 suffice.

  - The event containing this sentence is dated 2025-07-22 (matches the explicit date in the sentence).
Assumptions:
- Use the calendar date 2025-07-22 as the completion point for the evaluation.
- No time-of-day information is provided here; for a days-based span we will use the dates only (calendar-day precision).
Absolute dates:
- Evaluation completion: 2025-07-22.

N2-S8:
- Time information from this sentence:
  - Gives an explicit scheduled range for the two-week clinic: from 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18.
- Event date:
  - The event containing this sentence is dated 2025-07-22; however the sentence itself specifies the future clinic dates explicitly.
Assumptions:
- Use the clinic start date 2025-08-05 as the second point in time (the clinic start).
- The clinic start date is treated at calendar-day precision.
Absolute dates:
- Clinic start: 2025-08-05.
- Clinic end (not needed for the chosen span): 2025-08-18.

Additional sentences:
- None added. The two selected sentences uniquely provide the required dates (evaluation completion date and clinic start date).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed number of days between the completion of the evaluation and the start of the scheduled two-week clinic.
- This requires both sentences: N2-S0 supplies the evaluation completion date; N2-S8 supplies the clinic start date. Neither alone suffices.
- Avoid mentioning absolute dates in the question; explicitly state the assumption used for counting days (calendar-day difference using the dates given in the sentences).

[Answer derivation]:
- Evaluation completion date = 2025-07-22 (from N2-S0).
- Clinic start date = 2025-08-05 (from N2-S8).
- Compute difference in days:
  - Days remaining in July after (and excluding) July 22: July 23–31 = 9 days.
  - Days in August up to August 5 inclusive of the 5th: Aug 1–5 = 5 days.
  - Total elapsed days from 2025-07-22 to 2025-08-05 = 9 + 5 = 14 days.
- Alternatively, numeric difference: date(2025-08-05) − date(2025-07-22) = 14 days.

Notes on assumptions:
- Using calendar-day difference (no times of day used). If a time-of-day were used (e.g., completion at 10:45 a.m.), the elapsed time in hours/minutes could differ; here we compute whole days between the two calendar dates as supplied.

I reviewed the prior response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The calculation and derivation are correct: 2025-07-22 to 2025-08-05 is a 14-day elapsed interval using calendar-day difference.
- The question avoids quoting absolute dates directly and asks for the elapsed calendar days between the two points, with an explicit assumption that those points are to be used — satisfying the requirement to state assumptions in the question.
- The answer is concise and precise ("14 days") as required.
- However, the previous "additional_sentence_ids" and "additional_sentence_explanation" fields were left empty. The checking task specifically asked to list additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected earlier) and to explain the unique information each provides. To be fully compliant with the checking output format and instructions, I should list the selected sentence IDs (N2-S0 and N2-S8) and explain why each is necessary.

No changes were made to the question, the numeric answer, or the derivation — only the metadata fields (additional_sentence_ids and additional_sentence_explanation) are populated to reflect the required information.

Potential distractor choices: common off-by-one errors (13 or 15 days), confusing dates from other events (e.g., July 12 to Aug 5 = 24 days), using evaluation ratification date (2025-07-16 to Aug 5 = 20 days). The most plausible and challenging is 13 days (people often count exclusive of one endpoint or subtract because evaluation finished mid-morning). Use N2-S0 and N2-S8 as supporting sentences; add N2-S1 (10:45 a.m. end time) to make the "partial day" confusion plausible.
Finalize single distractor: 13 days, with brief explanation pointing out why it's incorrect and plausible, and include sentence IDs N2-S0, N2-S1, N2-S8.

<scratchpad>[Outline your reasoning including the derived absolute points in time here.]
(Repeat for all sentence IDs)
[Sentence ID]: N2-S0
- Describe the time information from this sentence:
  - States that "On 2025-07-22 Nadia Varnell completed the scheduled 45-minute evaluation of Sera Lortin" — provides the calendar date of completion and indicates the evaluation's scheduled total duration (45 minutes).
- Identify the event date:
  - The event date is given as 2025-07-22.
Assumptions:
- The evaluation referenced as "completed on 2025-07-22" occurred on that date (no ambiguity).
- The 45-minute scheduled duration refers to the single evaluation that began and ended on 2025-07-22.

Absolute dates:
- Completion date: 2025-07-22 (time of completion not specified in this sentence).
- Scheduled evaluation duration: 45 minutes (stated).

[Sentence ID]: N2-S1
- Describe the time information from this sentence:
  - Gives explicit start and end times: "The evaluation began at 10:00 a.m. and concluded at 10:45 a.m."
  - Confirms the evaluation activities and that the session spanned those clock times.
- Identify the event date:
  - This sentence is within the same event dated 2025-07-22; therefore the times refer to that date.
Assumptions:
- The times (10:00 a.m. and 10:45 a.m.) are on 2025-07-22.
- Both start and end times are in the same local clock (no timezone shifts) and on the same day.

Absolute dates:
- Start: 2025-07-22 at 10:00 a.m.
- End: 2025-07-22 at 10:45 a.m.

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences are required. N2-S0 provides the date, and N2-S1 provides the start and end clock times; both are necessary to identify full absolute points in time (date + time).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the evaluation start and finish. The question must not include the explicit times or dates; the solver must extract them from the selected sentences.
- Ensure the question requires both sentences: N2-S1 gives start and end clock times but does not state the date; N2-S0 supplies the date. Therefore, both sentences are needed to form the absolute start and end instants.

- For each selected sentence, the unique required information:
  - N2-S0: provides the calendar date (2025-07-22) and confirms the event happened on that date.
  - N2-S1: provides the specific start and end clock times (10:00 a.m. and 10:45 a.m.).

[Answer derivation]:
- Start instant: 2025-07-22 10:00 a.m.
- End instant: 2025-07-22 10:45 a.m.
- Elapsed time = End - Start = 45 minutes.

Goal: produce one plausible but incorrect distractor. Correct answer = 45 minutes (explicit in N2-S0 and N2-S1). Common plausible misreads:
- Confuse the in-pool portion (20 minutes) with total elapsed time.
- Use one of the subcomponents from N1-S5 (20, 15, 10) as answer.
- Use round numbers like "30 minutes" or "1 hour"—less tied to outline.
Most convincing: 20 minutes because N1-S5 explicitly scheduled a 20-minute in-pool technical review; someone might think the timed sets referenced are the whole evaluation. Use N1-S5 to make it sound plausible. Must ensure distractor is clearly incorrect: include explanation that it's only the in-pool portion and total elapsed was 45 minutes per N2-S1. Provide sentence ID(s) that make distractor plausible: N1-S5 only.

N3-S6:
- Time information: Commitment/deadline that Merrowgate Development Squad will submit Sera Lortin's medical clearance and arrival information "by 2025-07-30."
- Event date: 2025-07-28 (event containing N3-S6).
Assumptions:
- "By 2025-07-30" is taken as the target date 2025-07-30 (no specific clock time provided). For calculation of a whole-day span we treat this as the date 2025-07-30 (start-of-day to start-of-day comparisons will be used unless a time-of-day is specified elsewhere).
Absolute dates from this sentence:
- Planned submission date (deadline): 2025-07-30 (no time-of-day specified).

N4-S4:
- Time information: Merrowgate Development Squad forwarded the written medical clearance by email "on the evening of 2025-08-04"; it also notes they had previously aimed for 2025-07-30 but scheduling required reassessment on 2025-08-04, so clearance was sent same-day after that assessment.
- Event date: 2025-08-04 (event containing N4-S4).
Assumptions:
- "Evening of 2025-08-04" provides the actual send date as 2025-08-04 (no precise clock time given). For a day-based span we take the date 2025-08-04.
Absolute dates from this sentence:
- Actual forwarding date: 2025-08-04 (evening).

Additional sentences:
- None added. Both selected sentences supply the unique required dates: the planned-by date (2025-07-30) and the actual send date (2025-08-04). Both are required to compute the elapsed time.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the date Merrowgate had said it would submit the clearance and the date they actually forwarded it. This forces use of N3-S6 (planned-by date) and N4-S4 (actual send date). Avoid mentioning the dates in the question.

Unique information required from each selected sentence:
- N3-S6 provides the committed target submission date ("by 2025-07-30").
- N4-S4 provides the actual forwarding date ("evening of 2025-08-04") and the explicit statement that the clearance was sent on that date.
Both are necessary: without N3-S6 there is no committed-by date; without N4-S4 there is no actual send date.

[Answer derivation]:
- Planned submission date: 2025-07-30
- Actual forwarding date: 2025-08-04
Compute days elapsed from 2025-07-30 to 2025-08-04:
- 2025-07-30 → 2025-07-31 = 1 day
- 2025-07-31 → 2025-08-01 = 2 days
- 2025-08-01 → 2025-08-02 = 3 days
- 2025-08-02 → 2025-08-03 = 4 days

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified the two absolute dates (planned-by date 2025-07-30 from N3-S6 and actual forwarding date evening of 2025-08-04 from N4-S4), stated assumptions, computed the elapsed time (5 days), and produced an appropriate question that avoids explicit dates.
- The derivation and reasoning were clear and correct.
- One minor omission: the output's <additional_sentence_ids> and <additional_sentence_explanation> fields were left empty. The task's final output format asks to list any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (if applicable) and to explain the unique information of each additional sentence that is required. In this case, both selected sentences are required and should be listed and explained. This is a small compliance issue rather than a substantive error in reasoning.

Correction made:

Assumptions:

Absolute dates:
- Notification = 2025-07-28 (calendar day).

N4-S0:

Assumptions:

Absolute dates:

Additional sentences:
- None selected beyond N3-S0 and N4-S0 are required. Both sentences uniquely provide the two calendar dates needed to compute the span; no other sentence in the outline provides the same pair of dates.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time in days between the notification of a minor shoulder complaint (the date given in N3-S0) and the on-site physiotherapist reassessment that followed (the evening date given in N4-S0). Framing the question this way forces use of both sentences to extract the two calendar dates; the question will not include any absolute dates itself and will require temporal calculation.

- Unique information required from each sentence:
  - N3-S0 provides the notification calendar date (start point).
  - N4-S0 provides the reassessment calendar date (end point).
Both are necessary; without either, the span cannot be determined.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start date: 2025-07-28 (from N3-S0).
- End date: 2025-08-04 (from N4-S0, evening).
- Calculate days elapsed (end date minus start date): 
  - July 28 → July 29 = 1 day
  - July 29 → July 30 = 1 day (2 total)
  - July 30 → July 31 = 1 day (3 total)

Goal: produce 1 plausible but incorrect distractor. Correct answer 7 days (07-28 to 08-04). Choose a distractor that is realistic and could be mistakenly inferred from other dates in the outline.

Potential wrong values:
- 2 days (07-28 to 07-30) — plausible because Merrowgate aimed to submit clearance by 07-30 (N3-S6, N4-S4). Mistake: conflating planned submission date with actual reassessment.
- 6 days — plausible as off-by-one counting error (not counting one endpoint). Less tied to other sentences.
- 8 days — plausible if counting inclusively + off-by-one; but weaker linkage.

Prefer 2 days because it ties directly to other explicit dates in the outline and is tempting/misleading. Include sentences that make it plausible: N3-S0 (notification 07-28), N3-S6 (Merrowgate said they'd submit by 07-30), N4-S4 (says they had aimed for 07-30 but reassessment occurred on 08-04).

Potential pairs:
- (N3-S6, N3-S7): S6 gives a submission deadline "by 2025-07-30"; S7 gives a provisional arrival "evening of 2025-08-04". Direct dates -> can compute days between submission date and arrival date.
- (N3-S6, N3-S9): S6 gives submission deadline "by 2025-07-30"; S9 gives classroom hold start "2025-08-05". Direct dates -> can compute days between submission date and clinic-classroom start.
- (N3-S0, N3-S1): S0 gives notification date 2025-07-28 and S1 gives the notification time 10:15 a.m.; these together yield a timestamp, but need a second distinct time point to compute a span — less useful alone.
- (N3-S1, N3-S0) combined with other sentences could yield timestamps, but the clearest, least-ambiguous spans come from S6 with S7 and S9.

Decision: include two time-span tuples:
1) N3-S6 & N3-S7 (submission by 2025-07-30 → arrival evening 2025-08-04) = 5 days.
2) N3-S6 & N3-S9 (submission by 2025-07-30 → classroom start 2025-08-05) = 6 days.

N3-S6:
- Time information: Merrowgate Development Squad will submit Sera Lortin's medical clearance and arrival information "by 2025-07-30."
- Event date: The event containing this sentence is dated 2025-07-28 (the event date is the latest possible date for items in this event), but the sentence itself contains an absolute date (2025-07-30) that is after the event date.
Assumptions:
- The phrase "by 2025-07-30" establishes 2025-07-30 as the deadline/calendar date for the submission. No specific time-of-day is provided.
Absolute dates:
- Submission deadline = 2025-07-30 (calendar date; time-of-day unspecified).

N3-S7:
- Time information: Ivo Harlen provided a provisional arrival time of "the evening of 2025-08-04" and repeated that the submission on 2025-07-30 would include the clinician's clearance document and accommodation preference.
- Event date: 2025-07-28 (event date), but the sentence specifies absolute future dates 2025-07-30 and 2025-08-04.
Assumptions:
- "Evening of 2025-08-04" refers to that calendar date (2025-08-04), i.e., arrival occurs during the evening hours of that date. No exact clock time is given.
Absolute dates:
- Provisional arrival date = 2025-08-04 (evening of that calendar date).

Additional sentences:
- None required. Both N3-S6 and N3-S7 provide unique necessary pieces: N3-S6 provides the submission-by date (2025-07-30); N3-S7 provides the provisional arrival evening (2025-08-04). Both are required to compute the span between the two points.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the submission deadline and the provisional arrival evening. This requires extracting the submission-by date from one sentence and the arrival date from the other; neither sentence alone suffices.

Clarify assumptions to avoid ambiguity in calculation:
- Count whole days between the two calendar dates (i.e., from 2025-07-30 to 2025-08-04). Treat unspecified times as calendar dates; compute elapsed days as date difference (not inclusive count).

[Answer derivation]:
- Submission date: 2025-07-30
- Arrival date: 2025-08-04 (evening)
Compute days elapsed from 2025-07-30 to 2025-08-04:
  2025-07-30 -> 2025-07-31 = 1 day
  2025-07-31 -> 2025-08-01 = 2 days
  2025-08-01 -> 2025-08-02 = 3 days
  2025-08-02 -> 2025-08-03 = 4 days

I reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.

Findings:
- The previous response correctly identified absolute dates from N3-S6 (submission by 2025-07-30) and N3-S7 (provisional arrival evening 2025-08-04), stated assumptions, derived the elapsed time (5 days), and formed a question that avoids explicit dates and requires both sentences.
- The answer "5 days" is precise and concise.
- One minor omission: the final output did not list the selected sentence IDs (N3-S6 and N3-S7) in the <additional_sentence_ids> field. The current task's required output format asks to list any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question, including those selected previously. Even if no extra sentences beyond the originally selected are required, the original selected sentences should be reflected there for clarity.

Correction made:
- Added additional_sentence_ids with the two selected sentence IDs (N3-S6 and N3-S7).
- Added additional_sentence_explanation explaining the unique information required from each sentence.

No other changes to reasoning, assumptions, question, or answer were needed.

Goal: produce one plausible but incorrect distractor. Correct = 5 days (2025-07-30 to 2025-08-04). Common miscounts: counting exclusive vs. inclusive, off-by-one errors. Plausible wrong answers: 4 days (exclude one endpoint), 6 days (include both endpoints plus extra), 3 days (confuse dates), 1 week (7 days) — choose the most believable: 4 days is a common off-by-one and aligns with calendar-day counting mistakes.

N3-S6:
- Time information: Merrowgate Development Squad will submit Sera Lortin's medical clearance and arrival information "by 2025-07-30." This is an absolute deadline date contained in the sentence.
- Event date: 2025-07-28 (event date for this event), but the sentence itself supplies the later absolute date 2025-07-30.

N3-S9:
- Time information: Brindemoor Aquatic Complex placed a provisional hold on the clinic classroom "for the 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 period." This gives an absolute start date (2025-08-05) and end date (2025-08-18); the start date is the relevant point.
- Event date: 2025-07-28 (same event), but the sentence itself supplies later absolute dates in August.

Assumptions:
- "By 2025-07-30" is interpreted as the submission occurring on 2025-07-30 (the latest permissible date); the problem asks for the time span between two specific points, so we take the submission point as 2025-07-30.
- The provisional hold "for the 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 period" begins on 2025-08-05 (the first calendar day of the held period). We take that date as the second point in time.
- Use whole calendar days and compute the elapsed time from the submission date (2025-07-30) up to the classroom-hold start date (2025-08-05), exclusive of the start moment of 2025-07-30 and inclusive of the start moment of 2025-08-05 (i.e., simple day difference).

Absolute dates:
- Submission (deadline point): 2025-07-30 (from N3-S6).
- Classroom hold start: 2025-08-05 (from N3-S9).

Question Idea:
- Ask: Under the assumption that the submission occurs on the specified deadline date and that Brindemoor's provisional hold begins on the first day of its held period, how many days elapsed between the submission and the classroom hold's start?
- This formulation requires both sentences: N3-S6 supplies the submission deadline date and N3-S9 supplies the classroom-hold start date. Neither sentence alone gives both points; both are required.

[Answer derivation]:
Compute days between 2025-07-30 and 2025-08-05.
- 2025-07-30 → 2025-07-31 = 1 day
- 2025-07-31 → 2025-08-01 = 1 day (total 2)
- 2025-08-01 → 2025-08-02 = 1 day (total 3)
- 2025-08-02 → 2025-08-03 = 1 day (total 4)

Problems found:
- The original response correctly computed the duration between 2025-07-30 and 2025-08-05 as 6 days and followed many instructions (question omits absolute dates, assumptions stated, derivation shown). 
- However, it did not address the requirement that "no other sentence from the <complete_outline> is sufficient to answer the question and that no other sentence from the <complete_outline> can replace any of the selected sentence in answering the question." Sentence N2-S8 in the complete outline also states the clinic dates (2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18). That means another sentence could supply the hold/start date, so the selected sentences are not uniquely required as demanded.
- To correct this while making minimal changes, include N2-S8 as an additional sentence ID and explain its role. Listing N2-S8 acknowledges that another sentence contains the same date information and documents why it is being included (to ensure the start date is explicitly anchored to the clinic schedule as well as the Brindemoor hold).

Corrections made:
- Added N2-S8 to additional_sentence_ids and provided an explanation clarifying that N2-S8 supplies the clinic schedule dates (2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18), which matches the hold period in N3-S9. This makes explicit that the start date used in the calculation is corroborated by both the Federation schedule (N2-S8) and the Brindemoor hold (N3-S9), resolving the potential replacement issue.

No other changes to the question, answer, assumptions, or computed duration were needed.

Possible miscounts:
- Inclusive counting (count both July 30 and Aug 5) yields 7 days — plausible mistake.
- Off-by-one from thinking July 30 to Aug 5 is from 30→31 (1) ... →5 (6) but someone might count 30 as day 1 giving 7.
- Use sentences that reference the submission deadline (N3-S6) and the classroom hold start (N3-S9) to make distractor believable.
Choose distractor = "7 days" because it's a common arithmetic/counting error and directly tied to the two dates in the outline.

<answer>7 days</answer>
<explanation>This is incorrect because the actual elapsed time from the submission deadline (2025-07-30) to the classroom hold start (2025-08-05) is 6 days; "7 days" arises from inclusive counting of both the start and end dates, which the question does not ask for.</explanation>

- Treat "about 25 minutes" as exactly 25 minutes.
- The reassessment's start and duration occurred on the event date (2025-08-04) and produced an end time on that same date.
Absolute dates/times from this sentence:
- Start: 2025-08-04 19:10

Absolute dates/times from this sentence:

No additional sentences are required because both selected sentences provide the necessary times (reassessment start and duration; email send time) and share the same event date.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the reassessment ending and the clearance email being sent.
- Require using both sentences: N4-S1 to compute reassessment end time, N4-S5 to obtain email send time.
- Make clear that the approximate/approx. and about wording should be treated as exact for computation (an explicit assumption), but do not restate the numeric times in the question—reference "the times given in the selected sentences" to force the solver to use those sentences.

[Answer derivation]:

- Email sent = 20:03 on 2025-08-04.

I reviewed the prior response against the task instructions. The original answer correctly identified and used the times in N4-S1 and N4-S5, computed the reassessment end time, and computed the elapsed interval to the email time. The question avoided stating absolute times and required treating "approximately" and "about" as exact (an explicit assumption). The computed duration (28 minutes) is correct.

One minor correction/improvement: the previous response left <additional_sentence_ids> empty. The check instruction requests listing any additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected previously). To be explicit and to satisfy the checker's requirement, I will include the two selected sentence IDs (N4-S1 and N4-S5) as required sentences and explain their unique contributions and the necessary assumption.

No other changes are needed.

Summary of justification:
- N4-S1 is required to derive the reassessment end time (it provides start time and duration).
- N4-S5 is required to provide the email send time.
- The assumption (carried over) that "approximately 19:10" and "about 25 minutes" are treated as exact values is necessary and was explicitly stated in the original scratchpad; it is retained here.

No further corrections to the numeric computation or the question wording were necessary.

Goal: create one plausible but incorrect distractor for elapsed time between end of physiotherapist reassessment and sending of clearance email. Correct is 28 minutes (reassessment: began 19:10, lasted 25 min → end 19:35; email at 20:03 → 28 min).

Potential miscalculations to use:
- Subtract start time from email time: 20:03 − 19:10 = 53 minutes (plausible error if someone ignores duration). Uses N4-S1 and N4-S5.
- Subtract duration from email time incorrectly: 20:03 − 25 min = 19:38 → 25 minutes? Not clean.
- Use reassessment end as 19:35 but mis-subtract to get 1 hour and 28 minutes? No.
- Use reassessment began "approximately 19:10" and treat "approximately" as exact per instructions; but could pick 48 minutes (if someone treated "about 25 minutes" as 28 minutes and did 20:03 − (19:10+28) => 35? messy).

Best distractor: 53 minutes — clear plausible error (using start time instead of end). Meets guidelines: clearly incorrect, plausible, uses outline sentences N4-S1 and N4-S5. Prepare explanation pointing out the miscalculation.

Ensure format: single distractor block with answer, explanation, and distractor-sentences listing IDs comma-separated.

Include brief explanation why it's incorrect but plausible.

N4-S5:
- Time information: "sent the clearance ... in a 20:03 email" and "same-day after that assessment" indicates the email was sent on the evening of the physiotherapist reassessment.
- Event date: The sentence is in event dated 2025-08-04.
Assumptions:
- The "20:03 email" occurred on 2025-08-04 at 20:03 local time (the event date).
Absolute dates:

- Event date: This sentence is in the same event dated 2025-08-04.
Assumptions:
- The "21:14" timestamp refers to 2025-08-04 21:14 local time (the same evening).
Absolute dates:
- 2025-08-04 21:14 (Carterline Federation issued the approval email).

No additional sentences required.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time between the Merrowgate email that sent the clearance PDF and the federation's approval email issued later that same evening.
- Unique information required from N4-S5: the exact send time of the clearance email (20:03) and that it was sent on the evening of the reassessment (hence same date).
- Unique information required from N4-S7: the exact issue time of the approval email (21:14) and that it was issued that evening.
- The question must not state the times explicitly; the solver must extract them from the two selected sentences.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start: 2025-08-04 20:03 (clearance email sent).
- End: 2025-08-04 21:14 (approval email issued).

The checking task asks to list the additional sentence IDs required to answer the question (including those selected previously). To be explicit and fully compliant, the response should list N4-S5 and N4-S7 in <additional_sentence_ids> and explain what unique information each provides.
- The assumptions (that the timestamps refer to the same event date, 2025-08-04) were stated in the original scratchpad; those should be retained.

Corrections made:
- Added the two required sentence IDs (N4-S5 and N4-S7) in <additional_sentence_ids>.
- Added brief explanations of the unique information provided by each sentence in <additional_sentence_explanation>.
- Kept the question and answer unchanged, as they were already correct and met the requirements.

We need one plausible but incorrect distractor. Correct elapsed time is 1 hour 11 minutes (from 20:03 to 21:14).

Potential mistaken intervals that feel believable based on other times in outline:
- 44 minutes (20:30 check-in to 21:14) — plausible because Ivo Harlen checked in at ~20:30 (N4-S9), so someone might compute from that time instead of the 20:03 email.
- 1 hour 7 minutes (confusing 20:07 vs 21:14) — less tied to text.
- 25 minutes (19:49 to 20:14) — not relevant.

Best distractor: 44 minutes. It ties directly to N4-S9 (20:30) and N4-S7 (21:14), and referencing N4-S5 (20:03) shows the real send time so the distractor is clearly wrong but plausible.

Include explanation why incorrect and which sentence IDs make it plausible: N4-S9 (20:30 check-in), N4-S7 (21:14 approval), N4-S5 (20:03 send) to show the contrast.

Keep phrasing concise.

<answer>44 minutes</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the clearance email was sent at 20:03 and the approval was issued at 21:14, which is 1 hour 11 minutes, not 44 minutes. The 44-minute figure is a plausible mistake because Ivo Harlen's check-in at about 20:30 (N4-S9) is 44 minutes before the 21:14 approval (N4-S7), which could be misread as the clearance-send time.</explanation>

I will identify sentences that include the bridge entity (Ivo Harlen) and look for connections across the two events (2025-07-12 and 2025-07-16). Possible sentence IDs (all contain Ivo Harlen) are N0-S6, N0-S7 (from event 1) and N1-S6, N1-S7 (from event 2).

1. Inspect sentences for unique information about Ivo Harlen:
- N0-S6: Ivo Harlen commented that Sera executed the practiced race plan and that her second-half pace sealed the finish. (Coach quote about race execution)
- N0-S7: Ivo Harlen stated Sera produced a negative split, gave the second 100m time (59.20s), and credited targeted 8x100 race-pace sets in training for the strong finish. (Specifies a particular training set tied to performance)
- N1-S6: Merrowgate confirmed Ivo Harlen will accompany Sera to a one-on-one evaluation with Nadia Varnell. (Ivo's role at the scheduled evaluation)
- N1-S7: Merrowgate stated Ivo Harlen will bring Sera's recent training log, official race split sheets, and a short written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets for the evaluation. (Specifies documents he will bring—ties directly to N0-S7's mention of 8x100 sets)

2. Look for cross-event connections forming a multi-hop reasoning chain:
- A natural, informative multi-hop link connects N0-S7 (coach credits 8x100 race-pace sets for the race outcome) with N1-S7 (the coach will bring a written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets to the evaluation). Combining these two sentences allows questions that require reasoning about which training element the coach credited and which material he planned to present at the evaluation.

3. Evaluate uniqueness / KB overlap:
- The known-named-entities entry lists Ivo Harlen as a coach, but does not contain the specific statements about negative split times, the coach crediting the 8x100 sets, nor the fact that he will bring the written summary and specific documents to the evaluation. Thus these sentences provide unique, non-redundant details suitable for multi-hop questions.

4. Candidate pairs considered:
- (N0-S7, N1-S7): Strong semantic overlap (8x100 race-pace sets) and clear multi-hop potential; meets the requirement to cover both events and both include the bridge entity.
- Other combinations (e.g., N0-S6 with N1-S7 or N1-S6) are possible, but N0-S7+N1-S7 gives the most direct and interesting two-step inference linking credited training work to the documentation the coach will bring.

Based on this, I will produce one selection pairing N0-S7 (event 1) with N1-S7 (event 2).
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N0-S7, N1-S7</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both mention Coach Ivo Harlen and connect a specific training element (the targeted 8x100 race-pace sets that he credited for Sera's strong finish in the championship final) with the materials he will bring to the subsequent evaluation (a short written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets). Together they form a clear multi-hop chain across the two events: the coach attributes performance to a particular training set, and he will present documentation about that same set at the follow-up evaluation—ideal for generating challenging multi-hop questions that require linking the credited training practice to the items the coach will provide.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N0-S7: Coach Ivo Harlen said Sera Lortin produced a negative split, covering the second 100 meters in 59.20 seconds, and credited targeted 8x100 race-pace sets in training for the strong finish.
  Unique details: "covered the second 100 meters in 59.20 seconds" and credited "targeted 8x100 race-pace sets" — identification detail to paraphrase the coach.
- N1-S7: Merrowgate Development Squad stated that Ivo Harlen will bring Sera Lortin's recent training log, official race split sheets from the championship, and a short written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets for review during the evaluation.
  Unique details: He will bring three items, specifically including "a short written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets."

Idea:
Paraphrase the bridge entity using the unique timing detail from N0-S7 ("the coach who said Sera covered the second 100 meters in 59.20 seconds") and ask which item he will bring that documents the team's 8x100 race-pace sets (information from N1-S7). The answer should be concise: "a short written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets."

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences are needed. The identification phrase comes from N0-S7 and the inventory of items to be brought (including the specific summary) comes from N1-S7. Together they are sufficient.

Verification:
- Does the question avoid naming the bridge entity? Yes — it paraphrases as "the coach who said Sera covered the second 100 meters in 59.20 seconds."
- Is the requested answer a specific item from N1-S7? Yes — "a short written summary of the team's 8x100 race-pace sets."
- Does answering require both sentences? Yes — identification uses N0-S7; the item comes from N1-S7. Without both, the mapping would not be possible.
- Is the answer concise and factual? Yes.

I need several false-premise questions each changing one key detail from the selected sentences. Selected sentences: N0-S7 (mentions 59.20 seconds and credits 8x100 sets) and N1-S7 (lists items Ivo Harlen will bring, including a short written summary of the team's 8x100 sets). Create questions that are identical to original but change one small detail that contradicts either N0-S7 or N1-S7 (but not both). Ensure the changed detail makes the question impossible to answer from context.

Planned Qs:
1) Change the split time (59.20 -> 58.00) — contradicts N0-S7 only.
2) State he will bring a video recording of the 8x100 sets (instead of a short written summary) — contradicts N1-S7 only.
3) State he will bring only Sera's recent training log (omitting the short written summary) — contradicts N1-S7 only.

I need to pick up to 1 pair of sentences (one from event 1 (N0-*) and one from event 2 (N2-*)), both must include the bridge entity "Merrowgate Development Squad" and be from the provided possible IDs list. Eligible IDs from event 1: N0-S4, N0-S5, N0-S6. From event 2: N2-S6, N2-S7, N2-S8, N2-S9.

Goal: choose a pair that yields an interesting multi-hop question that links facts across events via the bridge entity. Also ensure the selected sentences contain specific information about Merrowgate that is not already present in the known-named-entities KB entry (which gives only a general description of the club).

Considerations for combinations:
- N0-S4: "The performance by Sera Lortin contributed directly to Merrowgate Development Squad securing the overall team title..." — gives Merrowgate's achievement at the championship (unique fact).
- N0-S5: "Merrowgate Development Squad finished the meet with 412 team points, clinching the title by a 28-point margin..." — numeric details about points and margin (unique).
- N0-S6: "Coach Ivo Harlen of Merrowgate Development Squad said..." — links coach to squad with a quote (useful linking person to organization).

Event 2 candidates:
- N2-S6: "Merrowgate Development Squad acknowledged receipt of Nadia Varnell's written recommendation and confirmed that Ivo Harlen will coordinate next steps..." — shows administrative action and mentions Ivo Harlen coordinating.
- N2-S7: "Merrowgate Development Squad stated it would confirm Sera Lortin's availability, provide the athlete's medical clearance and travel preferences..." — logistic commitments for the athlete.
- N2-S8: "The Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation scheduled the two-week regional skills clinic at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex ... and asked Merrowgate Development Squad to provide participant logistics for Sera Lortin." — Federation asked Merrowgate to provide participant logistics; links Merrowgate to clinic scheduling and location (Brindemoor).
- N2-S9: Federation requested arrival time, emergency contact, dietary/accommodation needs by deadline and noted clinic schedule — contains detailed request items.

Best pairing: N0-S4 (Merrowgate secured the overall team title thanks to Sera's performance) + N2-S8 (Federation scheduled clinic at Brindemoor and asked Merrowgate to provide participant logistics). Reasoning:
- Both sentences explicitly contain the bridge entity name.
- They come from different events (one from the championship event, one from the post-evaluation/administration event).
- Together they enable a multi-hop question that requires linking Merrowgate's championship role to its administrative role in arranging Sera's participation in the upcoming clinic (e.g., "Which squad that secured the overall team title was asked by the Federation to provide participant logistics for Sera Lortin's clinic at Brindemoor?").
- The facts (securing the team title; being asked to provide participant logistics for Sera for a specifically scheduled clinic at Brindemoor with dates) are not present in the known-named-entities KB entry — the KB only has a generic description of Merrowgate — so these sentences add unique, necessary information for the multi-hop inference.

No other candidate pair provides as clean a cross-event link with distinctive, non-redundant facts about the bridge entity while remaining concise and useful for a challenging multi-hop question. Therefore I will output this single selection.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N0-S4, N2-S8</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both name Merrowgate Development Squad and supply distinct, complementary facts across events: N0-S4 reports that Sera Lortin's performance directly contributed to Merrowgate securing the overall team title at the championship, while N2-S8 states the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation scheduled a two-week regional skills clinic at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex and asked Merrowgate Development Squad to provide participant logistics for Sera Lortin. Together they enable a multi-hop question linking Merrowgate's competition success to its administrative role in arranging Sera's clinic participation; the specific achievements and logistics requests are not present in the known-named-entities entry, so both sentences are necessary to answer such a question.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N0-S4: "The performance by Sera Lortin contributed directly to Merrowgate Development Squad securing the overall team title at the Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship."
  Unique info: Sera Lortin's performance directly contributed to a specific team (the one that secured the overall team title).

- N2-S8: "The Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation scheduled the two-week regional skills clinic at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex to run from 2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18 and asked Merrowgate Development Squad to provide participant logistics for Sera Lortin."
  Unique info: A two-week regional skills clinic was scheduled at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex with exact dates (2025-08-05 to 2025-08-18) and the organizer asked the team (Merrowgate Development Squad) to provide participant logistics for Sera Lortin.

Idea:
Ask for the exact date range of the two-week regional skills clinic (specific, concise), while describing the bridge entity indirectly as "the team that secured the overall title thanks to Sera Lortin" (paraphrase from N0-S4). This forces use of both sentences: the paraphrase identifies which team is referenced (N0-S4) and the clinic dates come from N2-S8.

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences needed. Both selected sentences together supply the paraphrase identifying the team and the clinic scheduling details (dates and location).

Verification:
- Question does not mention Merrowgate Development Squad by name; it paraphrases using unique info from N0-S4 ("the team that secured the overall title thanks to Sera Lortin").
- The answer (clinic dates) is explicitly given in N2-S8.
- The question requires combining both sentences: it references the team identified by N0-S4 and asks for information about the clinic that that team was asked to provide logistics for (N2-S8).
- No other sentence in the outline provides these exact clinic dates or the specific request linking the team to supplying participant logistics; thus the details are unique to the selected sentences.
- The answer is short and unambiguous.

- Goal: find up to one pair of sentences (one from each event) that both mention the bridge entity Sera Lortin and together support a challenging multi-hop question.
- Examine sentences that include Sera Lortin (from provided possible_sentence_ids).
- Identify sentences that contain specific, unique facts about Sera Lortin not present in the known-named-entities entries:
  - N0-S7 (event 1): Coach Ivo Harlen added that Sera Lortin produced a negative split—covering the second 100 meters in 59.20 seconds—and credited targeted 8x100 race-pace sets in training for the strong finish. -> Unique numeric split (59.20) and training attribution.
  - N2-S3 (event 2): Nadia Varnell's written assessment included measured session data, citing three coached 50m closing efforts with an average split differential of roughly 0.15 seconds faster on the closing 50m as evidence of Sera Lortin's reliable race-closing speed. -> Unique measured evaluation data (three coached 50m closing efforts and ~0.15s differential).
- Consider potential multi-hop questions: combining N0-S7 and N2-S3 supports questions asking what evidence from both the championship final and the subsequent evaluation demonstrates Sera Lortin's strength in second-half/race-closing speed. This requires reasoning over both documents (coach's race-time split and evaluator's measured closing-50 data).
- Confirm constraints:
  1. Two events provided — selected pair covers both events (N0-S7 from first event, N2-S3 from second).
  2. Both selected sentences include the bridge entity Sera Lortin.
  3. The specific quantitative details (59.20s second 100; ~0.15s faster closing 50s) are not present in the KB and are unique to these sentences.
  4. Sentences are in the allowed possible_sentence_ids list.
  5. The pair yields an interesting multi-hop linkage: linking a competition performance metric with a technical evaluation to support a conclusion about race-closing ability.
- Conclusion: N0-S7 and N2-S3 make a suitable pair for generating a challenging multi-hop question about Sera Lortin's race-closing strength, supported by distinct quantitative evidence across two events.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N0-S7, N2-S3</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both mention Sera Lortin and provide complementary, quantitative evidence of her race-closing ability from separate events: N0-S7 gives the competition-side proof (a negative split with the second 100m in 59.20s and coach-noted training sets), while N2-S3 supplies measured evaluation data (three coached 50m closing efforts averaging ~0.15s faster on the closing 50m). Together they enable a multi-hop question that asks the reader to combine in-competition performance and post-competition evaluation findings to conclude that Sera Lortin's second-half pacing is a competitive strength.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N0-S7: Coach Ivo Harlen said the athlete produced a negative split, covering the second 100 meters in 59.20 seconds, and credited targeted 8x100 race-pace sets in training for the strong finish. Unique details: "second 100 meters in 59.20 seconds"; "targeted 8x100 race-pace sets" (training credit); "negative split".
- N2-S3: Nadia Varnell's written assessment cited three coached 50m closing efforts with an average split differential of roughly 0.15 seconds faster on the closing 50m as evidence of the athlete's reliable race-closing speed. Unique details: "three coached 50m closing efforts" and "average split differential ≈ 0.15 seconds faster on the closing 50m".

Idea:
Ask for the specific second-100m time (from N0-S7) while identifying the athlete by the unique measured-session description from N2-S3 (so the question requires consulting both sentences). The answer is a concise numeric time.

Additional sentences:
No additional sentences are required. The two selected sentences provide (a) the identification descriptor (three coached 50m closing efforts averaging ~0.15s faster on the closing 50m) and (b) the specific second-100m time (59.20s).

Verification:
- The question paraphrases the bridge entity using the unique measurement detail from N2-S3 without naming the athlete.
- The requested detail (second-100m time) comes uniquely from N0-S7.
- Both sentences must be considered to map the descriptor to the athlete and retrieve the specific time.
- The question avoids implying incorrect relations (doesn't suggest the athlete authored the assessment).

Candidate changes:
- Change the second-100m time that Coach Ivo Harlen reportedly gave (contradicts N0-S7).
- Change the written assessment's split differential direction from "faster" to "slower" (contradicts N2-S3).
- Change who reported the time from Ivo Harlen to Nadia Varnell (contradicts N0-S7).

Each question will include a single false premise and I'll cite which selected sentence it contradicts.

I need to produce unknown-premise questions by adding one specific unverified detail to the original question. The original asks for the second-100m time reported by Coach Ivo Harlen for the swimmer described in Nadia Varnell's written assessment. The selected sentences identify Sera Lortin and state Coach Harlen reported a 59.20-second second 100m and Nadia's note about three coached 50m closing efforts averaging ~0.15s faster. I must add one specific detail per question that is (a) possible given context, (b) not confirmed anywhere in the provided sentences or outlines, and (c) not refuted.

Potential unverified details that meet criteria:
- That Harlen reported the time at a post-meet press conference (not confirmed; his comment is noted "following the final" but no press conference is mentioned).
- That Harlen reported the time when speaking to the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation selection committee (possible; selection committee will review coach recommendations, but no record of Harlen speaking to them is given).
- That the 59.20 was reported by Harlen as the time recorded during one of the team's targeted 8x100 race-pace training sets (N0-S7 credits 8x100 sets for the finish but does not say the 59.20 came from an 8x100 set).

Each added detail is a single specific unverified element, not contradicted by any sentence. Now produce three QA pairs with brief explanations.

I need to pick up to 1 pair of sentences (one from the first event, one from the second) that both mention the bridge entity Sera Lortin and together support an interesting multi-hop question.

Step 1 — identify candidate sentences that mention Sera and contain specific, linkable facts:
- From event 1 (2025-07-12):
  - N0-S2: Sera Lortin, age 16, lowered the meet record in the 200m freestyle to 1:59.86 in the championship final.
  - N0-S3: previous record and margin to second place (0.35s).
  - N0-S4/N0-S6/N0-S7/etc. — details about team title, coach comments, splits/second-100 time (N0-S7 has 59.20 for second 100m).
- From event 2 (2025-07-28):
  - N3-S0: Merrowgate notified the Federation that Sera reported a minor shoulder complaint.
  - N3-S1: detailed email: minor left-shoulder tenderness first materialized after a timed interval set on 2025-07-25, managed with ice and modified training.
  - N3-S2/N3-S3: request for classroom/video-only clinic attendance and specifics of that request.
  - N3-S6/N3-S7: coach will accompany her and logistical details.

Step 2 — look for combinations that form an interesting multi-hop question:
- Pairing a performance fact (N0-S2 or N0-S7) with a later medical/attendance fact (N3-S1 or N3-S2) enables questions that require linking her record-setting performance to subsequent health status / clinic participation / timeline. For example:
  - N0-S2 + N3-S1: link from record time to when/why shoulder tenderness began (timeline from performance to injury report).
  - N0-S2 + N3-S2: link from record time to the type of participation requested at the clinic (performance → limited attendance).
  - N0-S7 + N3-S1: link training detail (negative split / second 100m, race-pace sets) to shoulder issue that occurred after a timed interval — could support a question about training load and injury onset.

Step 3 — check constraints:
- Both selected sentences must include the bridge entity — satisfied for any chosen pair above.
- Sentences must come from different events — I will choose one from event 1 and one from event 2.
- Ensure the specific information needed to identify Sera Lortin (e.g., the performance time and the date/description of the shoulder complaint) is not known from other sentences or the KB: the KB has Sera's DOB and profile but not the meet time or the shoulder-complaint timing/details. The chosen sentences therefore provide unique, necessary details for multi-hop reasoning.
- Choose the most straightforward, broadly useful pair: N0-S2 (clear, strong performance fact — meet record and exact time) and N3-S1 (detailed onset/date of shoulder tenderness and management). These two allow creation of various multi-hop questions involving performance → subsequent health issue/timeline/training modifications.

Conclusion: select N0-S2 and N3-S1 as the pair.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N0-S2, N3-S1</ids>
<explanation>These two sentences both mention Sera Lortin and link two distinct but related facts: her record-setting 200m freestyle time (1:59.86) at the championship final (N0-S2) and the later, specific report that she experienced minor left-shoulder tenderness that first appeared after a timed interval on 2025-07-25 and was managed with ice and modified training (N3-S1). Together they support multi-hop questions that require reasoning across performance and subsequent medical/timeline information (e.g., relating a peak performance to a later injury report or asking when the shoulder issue began relative to the meet).</explanation>

I must pick up to 1 tuple of two sentences, one from the first event (2025-07-12) and one from the second event (2025-07-28). Both sentences must include the bridge entity Sera Lortin and be chosen only from the allowed sentence IDs list:
N0-S2, N0-S3, N0-S4, N0-S6, N0-S7, N0-S8, N0-S9, N3-S0, N3-S2, N3-S3, N3-S4, N3-S6, N3-S7, N3-S8.

Survey of useful candidates:
- From event 1:
  - N0-S2: Sera Lortin, age 16, lowered the meet record in the 200m freestyle to 1:59.86 in the championship final. This gives a clear performance fact (exact time, record).
  - N0-S7: coach noted Sera produced a negative split, second 100m in 59.20, and training detail — useful for linking to training/injury.
  - N0-S4/N0-S6/N0-S8/N0-S9: team title contribution, coach quote, result update — also relevant but less central than the record time.

- From event 2:
  - N3-S0: notification that Sera reported a minor shoulder complaint — concise statement of the issue.
  - N3-S2: request that Sera attend the regional skills clinic for classroom and video-review sessions only, deferring in-pool training — links health status to restricted participation.
  - N3-S3: elaborates the non-pool activities and physiotherapist offer — more detail on the requested restriction.
  - N3-S4: Federation requires clinician clearance for classroom-only participation — can be used to ask about approval conditions.
  - N3-S6/N3-S7: logistical accompaniment and submission timing — connect to responsibilities and timelines.
  - N3-S8: asked Brindemoor to reserve the classroom pending clearance — logistical tie to facility.

Choose a pairing that makes an interesting multi-hop question: linking Sera's record-setting performance (N0-S2) to the later request for classroom-only clinic participation (N3-S2) supports questions like "After setting the meet record, what type of clinic participation was requested for Sera Lortin?" or "Did the record-holder attend the clinic in-pool or classroom-only?" This requires linking the performance fact to the later attendance restriction.

Check constraints:
- Both selected sentence IDs are in the allowed list.
- One ID is from event 1 and the other from event 2.
- Both sentences include the bridge entity.
- The KB does not contain the meet time or the clinic attendance restriction, so both sentences provide unique necessary details for a multi-hop question.

Therefore select N0-S2 and N3-S2.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N0-S2, N3-S2</ids>
<explanation>These sentences tie two distinct, bridge-centered facts: N0-S2 gives Sera Lortin's record-setting 200m freestyle time (1:59.86) at the championship final, and N3-S2 describes Merrowgate's request that Sera attend the 2025-08-05 regional skills clinic for classroom and video-review sessions only (deferring in-pool training). Together they enable multi-hop questions that require linking her peak performance to subsequent medically driven participation restrictions at the clinic.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N0-S2: "Sera Lortin, age 16, lowered the meet record in the 200-meter freestyle by 0.4 seconds with a time of 1:59.86 in the championship final at the Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship."
  Unique details: age 16; lowered meet record by 0.4s; event = 200-meter freestyle; time = 1:59.86; occurred in the championship final at that championship.

- N3-S2: "Merrowgate Development Squad requested that Sera Lortin be permitted to attend the 2025-08-05 regional skills clinic for classroom and video-review sessions only, deferring Sera Lortin's in-pool training pending reassessment."
  Unique details: Merrowgate requested permission for Sera Lortin to attend regional skills clinic on 2025-08-05 for classroom and video-review sessions only; in-pool training deferred pending reassessment.

Idea:
- Describe the bridge entity using the unique detail from N3-S2 (the person Merrowgate Development Squad requested be permitted to attend the 2025-08-05 clinic for classroom and video-review sessions only) and ask for a specific factual detail from N0-S2 (the exact 200m freestyle time when she lowered the meet record).
- The answer is concise: "1:59.86".

Additional sentences:
- None needed. The description and the factual detail come solely from N3-S2 and N0-S2 respectively; both are sufficient and unique.

Verification:
- The question paraphrases the bridge entity using unique information from N3-S2 without naming her.
- The requested information (200m freestyle time) is available uniquely in N0-S2.
- Both sentences are required: the description identifies which person is being asked about (from N3-S2); the time comes from N0-S2. Without both, the mapping would be ambiguous or unanswerable.
- The question avoids assuming extra roles not explicit; it uses neutral phrasing ("the individual ... requested be permitted") rather than adding labels like "swimmer" that are not explicit in the selected sentence.

- N3-S4: Federation requires clinician clearance. (Mentions federation, but also references the squad indirectly.)
- N3-S6 / N3-S7: Coach will accompany and submit clearance; these mention the squad's logistic commitments.
- N3-S8: The Federation asked Brindemoor to reserve classroom pending medical clearance—mentions Merrowgate only indirectly in context of request.

Best pairing: N0-S4 (shows Merrowgate won, due in part to Sera) with N3-S2 (shows Merrowgate later requested Sera attend clinic classroom-only). These two sentences span events (meet result and later administrative action) and both explicitly name Merrowgate Development Squad. They enable a multi-hop question that links the squad's championship role with their subsequent care/administrative request (e.g., "Which team that secured the overall title later requested Sera Lortin attend the clinic for classroom/video-review only?"). The facts in these sentences are not redundant with the known-named-entities entry (which describes the organization generally but does not state they secured this title or made this clinic request), so the linkage requires reasoning across both sentences.

Sentence information:
- N0-S4: Sera Lortin's performance "contributed directly" to Merrowgate Development Squad securing the overall team title at the Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship. (Unique identification: the squad whose overall team title was directly aided by Sera Lortin.)
- N3-S2: Merrowgate Development Squad "requested that Sera Lortin be permitted to attend the 2025-08-05 regional skills clinic for classroom and video-review sessions only, deferring Sera Lortin's in-pool training pending reassessment." (Unique detail: the specific participation requested — classroom and video-review sessions only; in-pool training deferred.)

Idea:
Ask what participation that specifically identified squad requested for Sera at the 2025-08-05 clinic. The question will describe the squad by the unique detail from N0-S4 and ask for the concise participation request from N3-S2. The answer should be a short phrase: "Classroom and video-review sessions only."

Additional sentences:
- None required. The two selected sentences contain the unique identifying phrase and the requested participation detail; no other sentences are necessary.

Verification:
- The question paraphrases the bridge entity using unique text from N0-S4 ("the squad whose overall team title was directly aided by Sera Lortin..."), avoiding explicit use of the bridge name.
- The question asks for a specific fact that appears only in N3-S2.
- Both sentences are required: N0-S4 to identify which squad is meant, N3-S2 to provide the requested participation detail.
- The answer is concise and unambiguous.

<answer>Full clinic participation, including all in‑pool training sessions plus classroom video review</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — Merrowgate requested that Sera attend only classroom and video‑review sessions and explicitly deferred her in‑pool training pending reassessment; they did not request full in‑pool participation.</explanation>

<distractor>
<answer>Classroom sessions and supervised dryland/core‑strength work only (no video‑review)</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — although Merrowgate did mention supervised dryland/core work as part of non‑pool activities, their formal request specifically asked for classroom and video‑review sessions only, so omitting video is wrong.</explanation>

</distractor>

<distractor>
<answer>Non‑pool participation including classroom, video‑review and supervised dryland/core sessions, with Merrowgate’s physiotherapist available for on‑site reassessment</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — this option adds supervised dryland/core work and an explicit on‑site physiotherapist role to the squad’s request; the official request specified classroom and video‑review sessions only (deferring in‑pool work), so this expanded list is not the requested participation.</explanation>

<distractor>
<answer>Classroom‑only attendance pending a written clinician’s medical clearance (no immediate video‑review participation)</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — the squad asked for classroom and video‑review sessions specifically; requesting classroom without the video‑review component contradicts the squad’s stated request.</explanation>

<answer>Limited in‑pool sessions focused solely on starts and turns (no classroom or video‑review)</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — while the clinic content emphasizes starts and turns as priorities, Merrowgate’s request was to defer in‑pool training and permit Sera only to attend classroom and video‑review sessions, so asking for in‑pool starts/turns sessions is contrary to their request.</explanation>

I must create questions similar to the original but add one specific unverified detail each time. Use information from N0-S4 and N3-S2 (squad identity and requested participation). Ensure each added detail is possible but not confirmed or contradicted by any sentences in the context. Pick details that are substantial: time-of-day (afternoon), daily physiotherapist checks, use of the classroom's ceiling-mounted projector. Confirm none of these are stated or ruled out: times of classroom sessions are not specified; physiotherapist availability is offered for reassessment but daily checks are not documented; Brindemoor's AV setup is described but no explicit request to use the projector is recorded.

  - N0-S5: "Merrowgate Development Squad finished the meet with 412 team points, clinching the title by a 28-point margin over the second-place team in a field of 18 squads." (event 1)
    - Gives specific numeric details (412 points, 28-point margin, 18 squads) about the squad's victory.
  - N0-S6: "Coach Ivo Harlen of Merrowgate Development Squad said, 'Sera Lortin executed the race plan...'" (event 1)
    - Connects coach comments to the squad; less useful for administrative linkage.
  - N4-S0: "Merrowgate Development Squad physiotherapist Rowan Myles conducted an on-site reassessment of Sera Lortin at Brindemoor Aquatic Complex on the evening of 2025-08-04." (event 2)
    - Links the squad to medical/physiotherapy action and date.
  - N4-S4: "Merrowgate Development Squad forwarded Rowan Myles's written medical clearance... Merrowgate Development Squad had previously aimed to submit clearance by 2025-07-30 but scheduling required the physiotherapist reassessment to occur on 2025-08-04, so the clearance was sent same-day..." (event 2)
    - Contains administrative timeline and reason for same-day submission—unique operational detail.
  - N4-S5: "Merrowgate Development Squad sent the clearance as a PDF attachment titled 'S_Lortin_Clearance_20250804.pdf' in a 20:03 email to the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation selection coordinator..." (event 2)
    - Gives file name, timestamp, recipient role—specific administrative evidence.

- Look for pairs that span both events (requirement): choose one sentence from event 1 (N0-S*) and one from event 2 (N4-S*).
- Evaluate usefulness for multi-hop questions with Merrowgate Development Squad as bridge:
  - Good hops: event-1 sentence establishes the squad as the championship winner (identification by achievement); event-2 sentence establishes a later administrative action taken by the same squad (sending clearance, filename, timestamp).
  - Candidate pairs: (N0-S4 or N0-S5) paired with (N4-S4 or N4-S5). Which pair yields the most interesting multi-hop? 
    - N0-S5 (points & margin) + N4-S5 (exact file title and email time) yields questions combining competitive details and administrative specifics (e.g., "Which team that finished with X points later sent the clearance file named Y?").
    - N0-S4 + N4-S5 similarly links the squad's championship role to the clearance email specifics; slightly more focused on the causal link between athlete performance and later squad administrative steps.
- Check guideline 6 & 7: Ensure the KB does not already contain the specific information used to identify the bridge entity. The KB lists Merrowgate Development Squad as an organization, but does not state that it secured this championship title, its meet points, or that it sent a specific clearance file—so the selected sentences provide unique details not replaceable by KB.
- Choose one selection (limit 1). I select the pair that yields a clear, interesting multi-hop: N0-S5 (specific points and title-clinching detail) paired with N4-S5 (specific clearance file name and email timestamp). This allows forming questions that require linking a squad's competitive result to a later administrative action (e.g., "Which squad that finished the meet with 412 points sent the 'S_Lortin_Clearance_20250804.pdf' at 20:03?").

1. Candidate sentences that mention the bridge entity (Merrowgate Development Squad) from the allowed IDs:
   - N0-S5: "Merrowgate Development Squad finished the meet with 412 team points, clinching the title by a 28-point margin over the second-place team in a field of 18 squads." — provides precise competitive outcome and numeric details.
   - N4-S5: "Merrowgate Development Squad sent the clearance as a PDF attachment titled 'S_Lortin_Clearance_20250804.pdf' in a 20:03 email to the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation selection coordinator and included Rowan Myles's direct mobile number for same-day follow-up." — provides a later administrative action with exact filename and timestamp.
   - (Other possible sentences—N0-S4, N0-S6, N4-S0, N4-S4—also mention the bridge entity but offer less complementary uniqueness for a cross-event multi-hop pair.)

2. Cross-event requirement: Selected tuple must include one sentence from the first event (July championship) and one from the second event (August reassessment/administration). N0-S5 is from the first event; N4-S5 is from the second event — requirement satisfied.

3. Uniqueness check vs. known-entities KB:
   - The KB entry for Merrowgate Development Squad describes the organization generally (mission, founding, headquarters) but does not state that it won the Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship, did so with 412 points, or that it later emailed a specific clearance PDF at 20:03. Thus both sentences supply unique, necessary details not replaceable by KB.

4. Multi-hop potential:
   - Pairing N0-S5 and N4-S5 enables questions that require linking the squad's competitive identity (the team that scored 412 points/clinched the title) to a later administrative action (the specific file/email they sent). This produces a non-trivial reasoning chain across events (performance -> post-meet administrative follow-up), suitable for challenging multi-hop questions.

Conclusion: select the pair N0-S5 and N4-S5 as a single, strong cross-event tuple for multi-hop question generation.

Idea:
Ask for the numeric team points total (specific, concise) associated with the squad described by the unique action in N4-S5 (sending the PDF titled "S_Lortin_Clearance_20250804.pdf" in a 20:03 email).

- Identify sentences that contain specific information about the bridge entity (Ivo Harlen):
  - N0-S6: "Coach Ivo Harlen of Merrowgate Development Squad said, "Sera Lortin executed the race plan we practiced and her second-half pace sealed the finish," following the final at the Carterline Regional Youth Swimming Championship."
    - Contains: role (Coach), affiliation (Merrowgate Development Squad), a quoted assessment linking Ivo Harlen to strategy/race-plan commentary about Sera Lortin.
  - N0-S7: "Coach Ivo Harlen added that Sera Lortin produced a negative split—covering the second 100 meters in 59.20 seconds—and credited targeted 8x100 race-pace sets in training for the strong finish."
    - Contains: performance detail (negative split, second 100m time 59.20) and training attribution (credited targeted 8x100 race-pace sets), again attributed to Ivo Harlen.

- Look for connections between sentences that could form the basis of a multi-hop question:
  - Both sentences are quotes from the same bridge entity and together provide complementary facts: (a) evaluation of race execution and the decisive second-half pace, and (b) precise split/time and the training sets he credited. A multi-hop question could require linking the coach's attribution (training sets) to the measured performance detail (negative split/time) or linking his evaluation of the race plan to the training method he credited.

- Evaluate uniqueness of information:
  - No other sentence in the event text attributes these specific comments, times, or training attributions to anyone else. The bridge entity Ivo Harlen is only named in N0-S6 and N0-S7.
  - Known named entities list is empty for persons/organizations; therefore the detailed coach quotes and specifics are not present elsewhere.

- Conclusion:
  - The pair [N0-S6, N0-S7] is suitable for generating a multi-hop question that requires reasoning across two statements both attributed to Ivo Harlen (e.g., asking what training sets he credited and what split/time he reported, or asking how he explained the swimmer's finish and what exact second-100m time he cited).

<explanation>Both sentences are direct quotes from Coach Ivo Harlen and together provide complementary, unique details: N0-S6 gives his assessment that Sera executed the practiced race plan and that her second-half pace sealed the finish, while N0-S7 provides the quantitative negative-split detail (second 100 m in 59.20 seconds) and credits targeted 8x100 race-pace sets in training. This pair allows creation of multi-hop questions that require linking the coach's qualitative assessment to the specific split/time and the training method he credited—information found only in these sentences.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N0-S6: Identifies the bridge as "Coach Ivo Harlen of Merrowgate Development Squad" and quotes him saying "Sera Lortin executed the race plan we practiced and her second-half pace sealed the finish," following the final at the championship. Unique details: affiliation (Merrowgate Development Squad), quoted praise about executing practiced race plan and second-half pace sealing the finish, context "following the final."
- N0-S7: Same coach "added that Sera Lortin produced a negative split—covering the second 100 meters in 59.20 seconds—and credited targeted 8x100 race-pace sets in training for the strong finish." Unique details: asserted negative split, specific second-100m time 59.20 seconds, credited targeted 8x100 race-pace sets in training.

Idea:
- Paraphrase the bridge entity using the unique detail from N0-S6 (identify as "the Merrowgate Development Squad coach who said Sera executed the race plan we practiced") and ask for the specific second-100m split time reported by that coach (detail from N0-S7). The answer should be the concise time: "59.20 seconds."

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences are required. N0-S6 provides the paraphrase/identification of the coach; N0-S7 provides the numeric split time. Both selected sentences are necessary: the paraphrase uses N0-S6's unique phrasing/affiliation, and the numeric time comes from N0-S7.

Verification:
- Question does not mention the coach's name; it paraphrases him using unique info from N0-S6.
- The requested detail (the second 100 meters time) is explicitly stated in N0-S7.
- Answer is concise and factual.
- Both sentences are required: without N0-S6 the paraphrase wouldn't match, without N0-S7 the numeric time isn't available.
- No information from other storyline sentences was used.

<distractors>
<distractor>
<answer>1:59.86</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — 1:59.86 is Sera Lortin’s total 200‑meter freestyle time (the race-winning time), not the time for the second 100 meters; the coach specifically cited a 59.20‑second second 100. This choice is plausible because the overall time is emphasized in the outline.</explanation>

</distractor>

<distractor>
<answer>2:00.26</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — 2:00.26 was the previous meet record from 2018, not a split time; the coach described a negative split of 59.20 seconds for the second 100. This distractor is plausible because the prior record is explicitly mentioned in the outline.</explanation>
<distractor-sentences>N0-S3</distractor-sentences>
</distractor>

<distractor>
<answer>0.35 seconds</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — 0.35 seconds was the margin by which Sera touched the wall ahead of the runner‑up, not the duration of her second 100; the coach reported the second 100 as 59.20 seconds. This is plausible because 0.35 seconds is a notable timing figure in the report.</explanation>
<distractor-sentences>N0-S3</distractor-sentences>
</distractor>

<distractor>
<answer>1:00.66</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — 1:00.66 would be a plausible miscalculation (total 1:59.86 minus an incorrect assumed split), but the coach explicitly stated the second 100 was 59.20 seconds, so 1:00.66 is not what he said. This option is plausible because combining the total time and a mistaken split could lead to this figure.</explanation>

</distractor>

<distractor>
<answer>59.56 seconds</answer>
<explanation>Incorrect — 59.56 seconds is not the coach’s stated second‑100 time; he gave 59.20 seconds. This choice is plausible because it’s numerically close to the true 59.20 and could arise from confusing the 0.35‑second margin or rounding errors reported elsewhere.</explanation>

1) Identify sentences that contain specific information about the bridge entity (Sera Lortin):
- From event 1: N1-S0 states the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation formally ratified Sera Lortin's 1:59.86 time in the 200m freestyle on 2025-07-16 — specific performance/time information.
- From event 2: N2-S3 reports Nadia Varnell's written assessment included measured session data citing three coached 50m closing efforts with an average split differential of roughly 0.15 seconds faster on the closing 50m — specific technical session data about Sera's race-closing speed.

2) Look for connections between sentences for a multi-hop question:
- N1-S0 (ratified performance/time) -> establishes an accomplishment/performance baseline.
- N2-S3 (detailed measured session data) -> gives quantified technical evidence about Sera's closing speed observed during the evaluation.
- A multi-hop question could require linking the ratified result to the coach's quantified technical observations (e.g., "After the federation ratified Sera Lortin's 1:59.86, what measured evidence did the coach cite about her closing speed?").

3) Evaluate uniqueness and knowledge-base overlap:
- The known named-entity entry for Sera Lortin describes background attributes (DOB, nationality, role) but does not include the ratified 1:59.86 time nor the coach's measured split differential of ~0.15s.
- Neither piece of specific information (the exact ratified time nor the three coached 50m closing efforts / ~0.15s differential) is available elsewhere in the KB or other sentences; both sentences thus provide unique, complementary facts about Sera Lortin.

4) Consider how sentences form a challenging, interesting multi-hop question:
- The pair spans both events (ratification on 2025-07-16 and the subsequent evaluation on 2025-07-22), requires reasoning across an accomplishment and its technical assessment, and includes numeric/technical details that make for a precise multi-hop question.

Conclusion: N1-S0 and N2-S3 form a strong two-sentence combination for multi-hop questions centered on Sera Lortin (bridge entity), meeting all guidelines.

<explanation>These two sentences link a formal ratified performance (Sera Lortin's 1:59.86 in the 200m freestyle) with a later technical assessment that supplied measured evidence about her race-closing speed (three coached 50m closing efforts averaging ~0.15s faster on the closing 50m). Together they span both events and provide complementary, unique facts not present in the known-entity data, enabling multi-hop questions that connect the ratified result to the coach's quantified evaluation.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N1-S0: The Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation formally ratified Sera Lortin's 1:59.86 time in the 200-meter freestyle on 2025-07-16. (Unique details: ratified time 1:59.86; event: 200m freestyle; ratification date 2025-07-16; issuing body Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation.)
- N2-S3: Nadia Varnell's written assessment cited three coached 50m closing efforts with an average split differential of roughly 0.15 seconds faster on the closing 50m as evidence of the swimmer's reliable race-closing speed. (Unique details: three coached 50m closing efforts; average split differential ≈0.15 seconds faster on the closing 50m; cited as evidence of reliable race-closing speed.)

Idea:
- Ask for the average split differential (specific numeric detail from N2-S3) while uniquely identifying the athlete by paraphrasing the ratified performance and date from N1-S0. This requires both sentences: the paraphrase identifies which swimmer is meant (using N1-S0) and the numeric detail comes from N2-S3.

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences required. The paraphrase identification uses N1-S0 and the numeric detail is in N2-S3; both are sufficient.

Verification:
- The question does not use the athlete's name and instead paraphrases using the ratified time and date (from N1-S0).
- The answer (≈0.15 seconds faster) is directly from N2-S3.
- Both sentences are necessary: the paraphrase identification relies on N1-S0, and the requested numeric value relies on N2-S3.
- The detail asked is unique to N2-S3 and cannot be inferred from any other sentence.

Ensure each question keeps the original request (asking for the average split differential) but introduces a single contradictory fact that is mutually exclusive with one selected sentence only.

Possible single changes:

- Change ratified time (contradicts N1-S0).
- Change 50m to 25m (contradicts N2-S3).

I examined sentences that include the bridge entity Nadia Varnell from both events (allowed IDs list). I looked for pairs where one sentence sets up an action or decision that the other sentence supplies the substantive content needed to answer a question — i.e., requiring a multi-hop inference using Nadia as the bridge.

Candidate pairs considered:
- N1-S4 (schedules one-on-one evaluation on 2025-07-22) + various N2 sentences (which describe the completed evaluation). This is viable but many N2 sentences merely repeat the date/time or procedural details; less interesting as a multi-hop where the second sentence supplies unique evaluative content.
- N1-S8 / N1-S9 (selection committee will decide / will review Nadia's written evaluation within 72 hours) + N2-S2 / N2-S3 / N2-S4 (Nadia's written assessment contents or recommendation). These pairs create stronger multi-hop questions because the first sentence establishes that the committee will review Nadia's written evaluation and act on it, while the second sentence provides the actual content of that evaluation (what the committee will review or consider). This requires connecting who will review (selection committee) with what they will review (Nadia's assessment), so the answer cannot be obtained from a single sentence alone.

I selected the most direct and informative pair: N1-S9 (committee will review Nadia Varnell's written evaluation within 72 hours and apply selection criteria) together with N2-S2 (Nadia Varnell's written assessment noted Sera Lortin's second-half pacing is a clear competitive strength). This pair supports a clear, challenging multi-hop question (e.g., "What did Nadia Varnell note in the written assessment that the selection committee intended to review within 72 hours?") and contains unique evaluative content not present in the known-entities data.

<explanation>N1-S9 establishes that the Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation selection committee will review Nadia Varnell's written evaluation (and apply selection criteria), while N2-S2 provides the substantive content of Nadia Varnell's written assessment (that Sera Lortin's second-half pacing is a clear competitive strength). Together they form a multi-hop connection requiring linking who will review the evaluation with what the evaluation said — useful for a challenging question that cannot be answered from a single sentence or from the existing named-entity record.</explanation>

Sentence information:
- N1-S9: The selection committee intends to review Nadia Varnell's written evaluation within 72 hours; they will apply the federation's published under-17 selection criteria (including objective time thresholds, technical assessment, coach recommendations) when determining invitations to the development camp.
- N2-S2: Nadia Varnell's written assessment noted that Sera Lortin's second-half pacing is a clear competitive strength.

Idea:
Ask for the specific review timeframe (from N1-S9) while describing the reviewer by quoting the unique observation from N2-S2 (without naming Nadia Varnell). Example question: "Within how many hours does the selection committee intend to review the written evaluation authored by the person who noted Sera Lortin's second-half pacing is a clear competitive strength?" Answer: "72 hours."

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences are required. The selected sentences provide the necessary identification (N2-S2) and the timeframe (N1-S9).

Verification:
- The question paraphrases the bridge entity using the unique detail from N2-S2 ("the person who noted Sera Lortin's second-half pacing is a clear competitive strength") and asks for a specific detail (review timeframe) that appears only in N1-S9.
- The answer "72 hours" is concise and directly supported by N1-S9.
- The question requires both sentences: identification uses N2-S2; the timeframe is in N1-S9. It cannot be answered from either sentence alone.
- No other storyline sentences provide the exact "within 72 hours" review timeframe or the quoted phrasing about second-half pacing, so the information is unique and unambiguous.

- Goal: find one pair of sentences (one from event dated 2025-07-16, one from event dated 2025-07-28) that both mention the bridge entity Sera Lortin and together provide unique, linkable facts suitable for a multi-hop question.

- Candidate sentences from first event that include Sera Lortin (from provided list):
  - N1-S0: ratification of Sera Lortin's 1:59.86 time in the 200m freestyle on 2025-07-16.
  - N1-S2 / N1-S3: honorarium and payment details.
  - N1-S4 / N1-S5: scheduled one-on-one evaluation with Nadia Varnell on 2025-07-22 and location/details.
  - N1-S6 / N1-S7: Ivo Harlen accompanying Sera and materials to bring.

- Candidate sentences from second event that include Sera Lortin:
  - N3-S0: Merrowgate notified federation that Sera reported a minor shoulder complaint.
  - N3-S1: detailed email describing minor left-shoulder tenderness first after a timed interval on 2025-07-25, managed with ice/modified training.
  - N3-S2 / N3-S3: request to attend clinic classroom-only and specifics of activities/physio availability.
  - N3-S4 / N3-S5: federation requires clinician clearance details.
  - N3-S6 / N3-S7: Ivo Harlen confirmed accompaniment, arrival info, and that medical clearance would be submitted by 2025-07-30.
  - N3-S8: classroom reservation for Sera's video-review sessions.

- Evaluate combinations (must include one sentence from each event, both sentences must mention Sera):
  - Strong candidate: N1-S0 (ratified 1:59.86 on 2025-07-16) + N3-S1 (detailed shoulder complaint after timed interval on 2025-07-25). Rationale: links a performance milestone with a subsequent medical/availability issue; enables a multi-hop question that requires connecting the achievement with the later injury report and dates.
  - Alternative combos (e.g., N1-S4 with N3-S1) would link scheduled evaluation and later injury — also valid, but N1-S0 gives a concrete performance metric that is unique and more interesting for question formulation.

- Check guideline 6 & 7 (ensure the info isn't available from other sentences or the known named-entities KB):
  - The ratified 1:59.86 time and its ratification date are not in the KB; the shoulder complaint specifics (left-shoulder tenderness, onset after timed interval on 2025-07-25) are not in the KB. Both facts are unique to these sentences.
  - Both sentences explicitly include the bridge entity name (Sera Lortin), satisfying requirement 5.

- Conclusion: select the pair [N1-S0, N3-S1] as the single tuple.

</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N1-S0, N3-S1</ids>
<explanation>N1-S0 records a uniquely specific performance fact (Sera Lortin's ratified 1:59.86 in the 200m freestyle, effective 2025-07-16). N3-S1 provides a distinct medical/timeline fact (an email describing minor left-shoulder tenderness that first appeared after a timed interval on 2025-07-25). Together they form a strong bridge-based multi-hop pair: a question can require linking Sera's ratified performance to a later reported injury (and associated dates), and both facts are not derivable from the known named-entities KB, making the reasoning nontrivial.</explanation>

1. Task: choose up to one tuple of two sentences (one from 2025-07-16 event, one from 2025-07-28 event) that both mention the bridge entity "Sera Lortin" and together provide unique facts suitable for a multi-hop question.

2. Candidate sentences including Sera Lortin:
- From 2025-07-16 event:
  - N1-S0: The Carterline Regional Aquatics Federation formally ratified Sera Lortin's 1:59.86 time in the 200-meter freestyle on 2025-07-16.
  - N1-S2 / N1-S3: honorarium and payment processing details.
  - N1-S4 / N1-S5: scheduled one-on-one evaluation on 2025-07-22 with location and slot breakdown.
  - N1-S6 / N1-S7: Ivo Harlen will accompany Sera and bring training logs/race splits.
- From 2025-07-28 event:
  - N3-S0: Merrowgate notified federation that Sera reported a minor shoulder complaint.
  - N3-S1: detailed email describing minor left-shoulder tenderness that first appeared after a timed interval on 2025-07-25 and was managed with ice/modified training.
  - N3-S2 / N3-S3: request for classroom-only attendance at 2025-08-05 clinic and activity specifics.
  - N3-S4 / N3-S5: federation requires clinician medical clearance with specific content.
  - N3-S6 / N3-S7: Ivo Harlen confirmed accompaniment and stated the clearance would be submitted by 2025-07-30.
  - N3-S8: classroom reservation for Sera's video-review sessions.

3. Selection criteria check:
- Must pick one sentence from each event and both must mention Sera Lortin — satisfied by any pair chosen above.
- Facts must be unique and not derivable from the known named-entities KB — the ratified time/date (N1-S0) and the shoulder complaint details/onset date (N3-S1) are not in the KB.
- The pair should support an interesting multi-hop question linking performance and later medical status/timeline — N1-S0 + N3-S1 accomplishes this.

4. Decision:
- Select the pair [N1-S0, N3-S1] because they combine a concrete, ratified performance metric (1:59.86 on 2025-07-16) with a distinct later medical/timeline event (left-shoulder tenderness first noted after a timed interval on 2025-07-25), enabling multi-hop reasoning about the athlete's performance and subsequent injury/timeline.

<explanation>N1-S0 provides a uniquely specific achievement for Sera Lortin (ratified 1:59.86 in the 200m freestyle, effective 2025-07-16). N3-S1 supplies a distinct, later medical timeline (an email describing minor left-shoulder tenderness that first appeared after a timed interval on 2025-07-25). Together they enable a multi-hop question that links Sera Lortin's ratified performance to a subsequent reported injury and precise dates; both facts are not present in the known named-entities data, making the reasoning nontrivial.</explanation>

Known follow-up anchor: the history records a single, dated event on 2025-08-29 when Rivermark Lynx announced Maya Cortes's one-year contract extension, completed medical assessments, cleared her to progress into full-team contact training, and filed roster registration; no other scheduled follow-up events are listed. My continuations are therefore set after 2025-08-29 and explicitly tie causal links to that 2025-08-29 event (the club clearance, monitoring program, contract terms and registration) to remain consistent with the provided history and the sports genre. Summary 1 presents a plausible positive medium-impact next step (preseason appearance and incentive trigger) directly caused by the clearance and registration on 2025-08-29; causal_predecessor for summary 1: {"event_id": "EVENT-2025-08-29"}. Summary 2 presents a plausible cautious/negative medium-impact follow-up (minor training setback and minutes restriction) directly resulting from the club's ongoing monitored return-to-play program and initial clearance on 2025-08-29; causal_predecessor for summary 2: {"event_id": "EVENT-2025-08-29"}.

Known follow-up events from the provided history: on 2025-08-29 Rivermark Lynx signed Maya Cortes to a one-year extension, completed medical clearance and cleared her to progress into full-team contact training, and registered her on the roster, making her eligible for selection; the proposed continuations concern a preseason friendly dated 2025-09-07, which is after the clearance and registration and therefore consistent with selection and match participation. I created three mutually exclusive, positive, and plausibly realistic alternatives for what happened on 2025-09-07 that each conflict with the others (different incentive outcomes or club accounting practices) while keeping the central topic (Maya Cortes with Rivermark Lynx), the positive stance, the same low-to-medium impact level, and the same date.

<scratchpad>[Thoughts:
We must add up to one specific supplementary sentence after each original outline sentence. Keep details plausible and reporter-knowable. Avoid contradictions with known_entities and history. Stay within scope of the event (preseason friendly, Cortes appearance, assists, incentive, quote). Do not invent large new subevents.

For sentence 1 (match at Seaforth Community Arena): can add attendance figure (reporters often obtain) — choose a realistic mid-sized crowd (e.g., 1,120).

For sentence 2 (Cortes logged 18 minutes): add substitution detail and note she completed outing without needing additional treatment from medical staff, consistent with earlier clearance.

For sentence 3 (seven assists): add complementary box score stats (rebounds, steals) which are reporter-known and consistent.

For sentence 4 (club confirmed incentive triggered): avoid giving a precise monetary amount (not in history) — instead state administrative detail: fee processed as matchday incentive and counts immediately toward appearance thresholds.

For sentence 5 (quote): add an additional short post-match remark from Cortes indicating plans to build conditioning and integrate with younger teammates; this would be plausible in a follow-up in-person quote released by the club.

Ensure each added sentence is self-contained and uses full names; place new sentence directly after its original; do not alter originals; maintain chronological/logical flow.

I compared the new outline items to the previously recorded history for consistency.

- Dates: History records a one-year extension signed on 2025-08-29. The friendly is on 2025-09-07, which is after the contract signing — consistent.
- Medical status: The 2025-08-29 history states Maya Cortes was cleared to progress into full-team contact training after a monitored return-to-play program. The outline's note that she completed the outing without needing additional treatment is consistent with that clearance.
- Contract terms: The earlier history documents a per-appearance fee and appearance-based thresholds in the extension. The outline's statement that Maya Cortes's appearance triggered the per-appearance incentive and that the fee will be processed immediately aligns with the recorded contract terms.
- Performance details: Box-score stats (minutes, assists, rebounds, steal) and substitution timing do not contradict previous facts.
- Entities: The outline uses "Rivermark Lynx" and "Maya Cortes" exactly as in the entity list. New location/team names (Seaforth Community Arena, Marshgate Mariners) are not in the provided entity list but introducing them as new fictional locations/teams is acceptable and does not conflict with existing records.

No inconsistencies or contradictions were found. Therefore no changes to the storyitems are necessary.

I reviewed the history: Rivermark Lynx signed Maya Cortes to a one-year extension on 2025-08-29 with appearance-based incentives, then she played 18 minutes in a preseason friendly on 2025-09-07 that triggered her per-appearance fee (the 2025-09-07 match is the clear causal predecessor for follow-ups). Both continuations therefore concern the 2025-09-07 friendly and are dated on 2025-09-07 to remain consistent with the requirement that summaries either concern that event or occur before it. 
- Summary 1 rationale: a routine administrative follow-up (processing the matchday incentive and confirming it counts toward thresholds) is a plausible, low-impact immediate next step after the appearance was confirmed. Causal predecessor JSON: {"event_id":"2025-09-07"}.
- Summary 2 rationale: a medical check or precautionary training adjustment after a player returning from injury appears in a match is a realistic medium-impact follow-up; this is plausibly identified during the same-day post-match screening. Causal predecessor JSON: {"event_id":"2025-09-07"}.

Known follow-up events from the provided history: on 2025-09-07 Maya Cortes appeared for Rivermark Lynx in a preseason friendly (18 minutes), recorded seven assists, two rebounds and one steal, completed the outing without needing additional treatment from club medical staff, and the club confirmed her appearance triggered a contract per-appearance incentive. Any medical update for the same date must therefore be consistent with those match-day facts — for example, a post-match screening could detect mild tightness without contradicting the earlier statement that no immediate treatment was required. I verified the continuations keep the central topic (Maya Cortes' post-match condition), retain a neutral stance, maintain a medium-level impact (team-level availability and training modifications), and use the same date (2025-09-07). The three summaries below present mutually exclusive next steps (reduced training, limited clearance for light team practice, or short withdrawal and formal imaging/rehab), so if one occurs the others cannot concurrently happen.

I examined each of the five original outline sentences and identified areas where more concrete information could be added without altering the events described. For the contract signing, I can specify the exact base salary and per‑game incentive amount. For the league registration, I can give the registration number and confirm the deadline compliance. For Coach Loris’s comment, I can include a detail about the minimum minutes required for the incentive to trigger. For Sundara Sportswear’s statement, I can mention the name of the promotional campaign and a release date for the related jersey. Finally, for the cap‑space announcement, I can quantify the amount freed and name the target backup shooting guard and the date of the season opener. Each added detail is realistic, specific, and fits the sports context, and I will place each new sentence directly after its corresponding original sentence as separate <storyitem> entries.

I examined the outline for internal consistency and cross‑checked it against the (empty) entity and history sections provided. Since no specific entities or prior events were listed, I assumed that all named entities (Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club, Elara Finch, Midland Women's Basketball League, Coach Dana Loris, Sundara Sportswear, Lakeside Lynx, Maya Torres) are part of the established universe. 

The timeline is coherent:
- The contract extension is dated for the 2025‑26 season.
- Registration occurs before the league’s transfer deadline of 2025‑03‑20, and the event date (2025‑03‑15) is earlier than that deadline.
- The incentive clause (500 minutes) and the cap‑space reallocation ($12,000) are logically consistent.
- Promotional activities and the jersey release (April 5) fit after the contract signing.
- The planned signing of Maya Torres before the season opener on October 2 aligns with the freed cap space.

The only technical issue found was a mismatched closing tag in the original outline (`<storyitems>` instead of `</storyitems>`). I corrected this tag to preserve proper XML structure while leaving the story content unchanged.

No contradictions with the (unspecified) entity list or history were detected.

    The provided history details several future‑looking actions: 
    1) Sundara Sportswear announced a limited‑edition “Rise Together” jersey featuring Elara Finch, scheduled for release on April 5. A logical follow‑up is the actual launch and initial market response. 
    2) The contract extension includes performance incentives that activate after 500 minutes of play; given the season starts on October 2, a plausible subsequent event is Finch reaching (or failing to reach) the incentive threshold, which could lead to a positive milestone or a setback such as an injury. To create diversity, I will craft one positive story about the jersey release and one negative story about Finch sustaining a minor injury that threatens her incentive earnings. Both events occur after the March 15 baseline and involve key entities (Elara Finch, Sundara Sportswear, Rivergate Rivets).

First, I identified the concrete facts from the history: on April 5, Sundara Sportswear released a limited‑edition “Rise Together” jersey featuring Elara Finch, and the original continuation states that the first 3,000 units sold out within 48 hours – a clearly positive, high‑impact event for the team, the sponsor, and Finch’s personal brand.

When crafting alternatives, I kept the following constraints:
- The central entity remains the “Rise Together” jersey and Elara Finch.
- The overall tone stays positive (sales are strong) and the impact remains high (significant sell‑through).
- The date stays 2025‑04‑05.
- Each alternative must be mutually exclusive with the others (different quantity sold or different time‑frame) so only one can occur.

I created three plausible yet contradictory continuations:
1. A higher sell‑through figure (4,000 units) in the same 48‑hour window.
2. The same quantity (3,000 units) but a longer sell‑out period (72 hours).
3. A slightly lower quantity (2,800 units) sold out within 48 hours – still a strong positive outcome, but at odds with the exact 3,000‑unit claim.

All three respect the sport‑focused, realistic setting and avoid exaggerated global impact.

<scratchpad>
I need to create a 5‑item outline for the April 5 2025 jersey release. Each storyitem must refer to full names of entities (Elara Finch, Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club, Sundara Sportswear, Rise Together campaign). No pronouns referring back to previous items. Keep each item atomic and chronological. Include sales sell‑out, proceeds allocation, athlete statement, supplemental production. Ensure date tag is 2025-04-05.

<scratchpad>
I identified five original sentences in the outline. For each, I added one specific supplementary sentence that provides realistic, verifiable details a reporter could know on April 5 2025. The added details cover the launch event (design, price, attendees), sales breakdown, projected proceeds and clinic logistics, a direct quote and clinic activity, and production specifics for the supplemental run. All new information aligns with existing entities and does not contradict prior history.

I compared each story item in the outline with the established history and entity list.

- The release date (2025-04-05) and the “Rise Together” jersey match the contract extension event that announced a limited‑edition jersey release on April 5.
- All persons and organizations mentioned (Elara Finch, Dana Loris, Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club, Sundara Sportswear) exist with the correct names and roles.
- The details about the jersey material, price, sales numbers, and supplemental production run are new information that does not contradict any prior facts.
- The community clinic in June 2025, including the specific June 12 date, is a logical extension of the club’s announced allocation of net proceeds; no prior date conflict exists.
- Minor typographical issue in the original outline’s closing tag (<storyitems> instead of </storyitems>) was corrected for proper structure.

No contradictions were found; only the closing tag was fixed. All story items are retained unchanged.

    The provided history outlines two concrete events: the contract extension on 2025‑03‑15 (EVENT‑1) and the jersey launch on 2025‑04‑05 (EVENT‑2). Both mention a planned community basketball clinic in Rivergate for June 2025 and a supplemental jersey shipment scheduled for early May 2025. Therefore, a logical next event is the execution of the clinic on 2025‑06‑12, directly triggered by the jersey‑sale fundraising (EVENT‑2).  
    For a contrasting, lower‑impact but plausible development, the roster change involving veteran guard Maya Torres is already set for the season opener on 2025‑10‑02. An injury or availability issue shortly after that date would be a realistic negative follow‑up, linked back to the earlier contract‑extension and roster‑building decisions (EVENT‑1). These two scenarios give us a positive community‑focused story and a modestly adverse team‑performance story, each anchored to a distinct prior event.

I first reviewed all recorded history. The latest dated events are the jersey launch on 5 April 2025 and the contract extension on 15 March 2025. No information exists for October 2025, so any development on 4 October 2025 involving Maya Torres is unrestricted by later events.  
The provided continuation describes a negative, medium‑impact incident (a sprained ankle causing her to miss the next game and a rookie being called up).  
To create three mutually exclusive alternatives I kept:
- the central figures (Maya Torres, Rivergate Rivets, Coach Dana Loris) and the date (2025‑10‑04);
- a negative tone (injury or limitation);
- a medium impact on the team (affects lineup or minutes but does not alter the season‑long trajectory).  
Each alternative changes the specific consequence of the injury—calling up a rookie, reducing minutes, or playing through—so that only one can occur. All summaries are concise, objective, and avoid the bracketed ID markup.

<scratchpad>[I reviewed each original sentence and identified areas where more concrete information could be added without altering the events. For the first sentence I can specify the opponent, the quarter and the score when the injury occurred. For the medical evaluation I can name the team physician, mention the diagnostic tool used, and note any immediate treatment. For the minutes limitation I can clarify the total minutes per game and the monitoring method. For the decision about Leila Kade I can give her position, recent performance stats, and her status on the roster. For the club’s statement I can add a direct quote from the communications director and reference the use of jersey‑sale proceeds for her rehab. Each added detail is a single, self‑contained sentence placed directly after its corresponding original sentence.]</scratchpad>

I reviewed each story item against the provided history and entity list.

All entities mentioned (Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club, Rivergate Sports Complex, Maya Torres, Dana Loris, etc.) match the existing records. New names (Dr. Lina Ortiz, Leila Kade, Sofia Marquez) are not contradictory; they are simply additional characters, which is acceptable.

The only inconsistency found concerns the use of “net proceeds” from the Rise Together jersey campaign. The history states that **all** net proceeds are earmarked to fund a free community basketball clinic in June 2025. The outline’s quote from Communications Director Sofia Marquez says the club will use “the net proceeds” to support Maya’s rehabilitation, which conflicts with the earlier allocation.

To resolve this, I modified the quote to indicate that only a portion of the net proceeds (or additional resources) will be used for rehabilitation, preserving the original intent while respecting the prior commitment.

No other contradictions were identified. The story items have been kept in their original order, with the minor wording change applied to the Sofia Marquez quote. The closing tag for the storyitems list has been corrected to </storyitems>.

I reviewed the supplied history and identified the most recent event: Maya Torres’ ankle injury on 2025‑10‑04.  The narrative indicates a pending recovery plan and that rookie guard Leila Kade was left on the bench at that time.  There are no explicit follow‑up dates beyond 2025‑10‑04, so I crafted two plausible next events that are consistent with the timeline.  

For the first summary I chose to shift the coaching decision regarding Leila Kade, creating a positive development that occurs shortly after the injury report.  The date 2025‑10‑15 falls safely after the injury event and is early enough to influence the upcoming game schedule.  

For the second summary I drafted a medical update from Dr. Lina Ortiz confirming Maya Torres’ rehabilitation progress, setting her return for the league opener on 2025‑11‑05.  This provides a significant development that logically follows the injury event and completes the recovery arc.  

Both summaries reference key entities (Rivergate Rivets, Coach Dana Loris, Leila Kade, Dr. Lina Ortiz, Maya Torres) and produce balanced positive news.  They are single concise sentences, comply with the required tags, and include a causal link back to the 2025‑10‑04 injury event.

The history shows that Maya Torres suffered a grade‑I ankle contusion on 2025‑10‑04, was placed on a limited‑minute schedule (12 minutes per quarter) for the opening month, and that the club pledged to use jersey‑sale proceeds to aid her rehabilitation. By 2025‑10‑25, Dr. Lina Ortiz is positioned to confirm the outcome of that rehab. The provided continuation states that Maya has completed rehab and will return for the season opener on 2025‑11‑05 – a positive, medium‑impact development (affects team roster and game‑day plans).  

To generate three contradictory alternatives while preserving:
* **Central topic & entity** – Maya Torres’ ankle rehab and return.
* **Stance** – positive (she will be fit to participate).
* **Impact** – medium (team‑lineup implications, not league‑wide).
* **Date** – 2025‑10‑25.

Each alternative adjusts the specifics of her return (starter vs. limited minutes vs. second‑half substitute). These details cannot all be true simultaneously, making the summaries mutually exclusive yet still realistic within the sport‑story context and consistent with prior injury‑management protocols.

I compared each story item in the outline with the established history and entity list.

- All entities (Maya Torres, Dr. Lina Ortiz, Coach Dana Loris, Communications Director Sofia Marquez, Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club, Rivergate Sports Complex, Midland Mavericks, Rise Together jersey) exist and match the names in the entity list.
- The timeline is consistent: injury on 2025‑10‑04, a three‑week rehab ending on 2025‑10‑25, and a season opener on 2025‑11‑05.
- No contradictions with prior events (e.g., the jersey proceeds, the injury protocol, roster size, etc.).
- The only inconsistency found was in story item 6, which stated Maya Torres would “log at least 30 minutes each quarter.” A basketball quarter is only 10 minutes, so “each quarter” is impossible. I changed the phrasing to “at least 30 minutes in the game” to keep the intended meaning (significant playing time) while remaining realistic.

All other story items required no changes.

The outline is now fully consistent with the prior history and entity definitions.

    The last recorded event in the history is the season opener on 2025‑11‑05, where Maya Torres was confirmed in the starting lineup and a fan meet‑and‑greet was scheduled for 2025‑11‑03.  Reasonable follow‑up events after this date include: (1) the outcome of the season‑opening game itself, which would naturally be reported shortly after the match; (2) a post‑game marketing action such as releasing a new jersey variant that highlights Maya’s return, building on the existing Rise Together campaign and the announced fan meet‑and‑greet; (3) possible roster updates (e.g., Leila Kade’s debut) or community‑clinic follow‑up, but those are less immediate.  I selected two distinct continuations: the first reports the game result and its impact on the team’s momentum; the second announces a new limited‑edition jersey featuring Maya’s signature, tying back to the Rise Together campaign and allocating proceeds to expand the community clinic.  Both summaries are single‑sentence, date‑specific, and reference main entities from the prior narrative (Maya Torres, Rivergate Rivets, Rise Together jersey, Rivergate Community Center).

The provided history ends with the announcement that the season‑opening game on 2025‑11‑05 will be a home contest between the Rivergate Rivets and the Midland Mavericks, with Maya Torres cleared to start, a fan meet‑and‑greet scheduled, and a live broadcast planned. No actual game result is recorded, so any plausible result that maintains a **positive** (team wins) and **medium‑impact** (season opener, notable but not league‑changing) stance is consistent with the known timeline.  

To create three mutually exclusive continuations, I keep the central entities (Rivergate Rivets, Midland Mavericks, Maya Torres, the 2025‑11‑05 game) while varying the final score and Maya’s statistical contribution. All alternatives remain positive (a victory for Rivergate) and of comparable medium impact, ensuring they could each plausibly replace the original summary but cannot all occur together.

I reviewed each of the five original outline sentences and identified areas where more specific information could be added without altering the events described. For each sentence I crafted one supplemental sentence that provides concrete details a reporter could know immediately after the game: broadcast analyst name, Torres’ shooting stats, biometric data confirming full‑minute play, jersey design and pricing, and a breakdown of the ticket sales. All added details are consistent with the known entities and history, and no new sub‑events are introduced.

I compared each story item with the established history.

- The opening tip‑off, broadcast details, opponent, and venue match the history.  
- Pre‑game analysis by Lucia Ortega is new but not contradictory.  
- Maya Torres’ performance stats are not mentioned elsewhere, so they are acceptable.  
- Coach Loris confirming full‑minute play aligns with the earlier statement that she is cleared to play full minutes.  
- GPS heart‑rate data is plausible and consistent with the use of wearable monitors.  
- The original outline said the jersey would be available “after the game.” History indicates the jersey would be available at the November 3 fan meet‑and‑greet (before the game). I removed the “after the game” phrase to keep it consistent.  
- The jersey description and price match the product data.  
- The final score is new information, no conflict.  
- The outline listed ticket sales of 2,950, but the history records 2,800 tickets sold. I changed the figure to 2,800.  
- Consequently, the attendance breakdown was adjusted to sum to 2,800 (1,200 season‑ticket holders, 1,300 single‑game purchasers, 300 walk‑in tickets).  

All other entities (people, locations, organizations, products) are referenced correctly by their full names. No other contradictions were found.

The outline is now consistent with the prior events and entity definitions.

    The last recorded event in the history is the season‑opening victory on 2025‑11‑05, which mentions ticket sales, a new Rise Together jersey featuring Maya Torres, and media coverage.  
    No specific future dates are given, so the next plausible developments are regular‑season games, community‑outreach follow‑ups from the jersey proceeds, and possible roster or disciplinary issues that often arise early in a season.  
    I created two diverse continuations:  
    1. A positive on‑court performance by Elara Finch in early December that boosts fan interest and ticket revenue.  
    2. A negative administrative incident in mid‑December where the club is fined for a roster‑eligibility violation involving rookie Leila Kade.  
    Both summaries reference entities already present in the knowledge base and occur after 2025‑11‑05, satisfying the requirement that they be future events.

The existing history ends on the 5 November 2025 season opener. No events are recorded for 3 December 2025, so the story can naturally progress with a mid‑season game against the Central City Cyclones. The original continuation describes a career‑high scoring performance by Elara Finch that lifts ticket sales – a positive, high‑impact development.  

To generate contradictory alternatives, I kept the same central elements (Elara Finch, Rivergate Rivets, game vs Central City Cyclones) and maintained the positive, high‑impact tone. Each alternative highlights a different standout achievement for Finch and a distinct downstream effect (ticket sales, merchandise, sponsorship). Because only one of these outcomes can occur in the same game, the alternatives are mutually exclusive. All summaries are concise, objective, and use plain names without the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} notation.

[N0-S2]:
- The sentence states the registration was recorded before the domestic transfer deadline of 2025‑03‑20. No exact date is given.
- The event containing this sentence is dated 2025‑03‑15. According to the guideline, when a sentence lacks a specific date we use the event date as the point in time.
Assumptions:
- The registration was recorded on the event date 2025‑03‑15 (the latest date consistent with “before the deadline”).
Absolute dates:
- Registration date = 2025‑03‑15 (derived from event date).

[N1-S0]:
- The sentence explicitly says the jersey was released on 2025‑04‑05.
- The event date is also 2025‑04‑05, matching the explicit date.
Assumptions:
- None needed; the date is directly given.
Absolute dates:
- Jersey release date = 2025‑04‑05.

No additional sentences are required; the two selected sentences provide all needed temporal information.

Question Idea:
Create a question that asks for the number of days between the league’s recorded registration of the extension (which occurred before the March 20 deadline) and the release of the limited‑edition jersey. The question must not mention the actual dates, forcing the answerer to extract the dates from the two selected sentences.

- Registration date: 2025‑03‑15
- Jersey release date: 2025‑04‑05
- Days between = 21 days (March 15 → April 5).

**Problems identified:**
1. **Missing explicit assumption** – The question asks for the number of days between the registration and the jersey release, but the exact registration date is not given in the selected sentence. The answer (21 days) relies on the assumption that the registration occurred on the event date (2025‑03‑15). The task requires any necessary assumptions to be stated explicitly in the question.
2. **Implicit absolute date** – While the question avoids mentioning specific dates, it does not clarify that the registration date should be taken as the event date of the first event. This clarification is needed to make the question uniquely answerable.
3. **Additional_sentence_ids** – The original response left this empty. Although no extra sentences are needed beyond the two selected ones, the IDs of the selected sentences should be listed for completeness.

**Corrections made:**
- Revised the question to explicitly state the assumption that the registration was recorded on the same day as the first event (the event that contains N0‑S2). This references the event date without naming the absolute date, satisfying the instruction to avoid absolute dates in the question while making the assumption clear.
- Added the IDs of the two required sentences (N0‑S2 and N1‑S0) in the `<additional_sentence_ids>` field.
- Provided an explanation of why each sentence is uniquely needed.

**Derivation (unchanged):**
- Registration date = event date of first event (2025‑03‑15 by assumption).
- Jersey release date = 2025‑04‑05 (explicit in N1‑S0).
- Days between = 21 days.

The corrected response now fully complies with the task instructions.

<question>Assuming the registration of Elara Finch’s contract extension was recorded on the same day as the first event (the event that contains the registration sentence), how many days elapsed between that registration and the release of the limited‑edition Rise Together jersey featuring her?</question>
<answer>21 days</answer>
<additional_sentence_ids>N0-S2, N1-S0</additional_sentence_ids>
<additional_sentence_explanation>
- N0-S2 provides that the registration was recorded before the domestic transfer deadline of 2025‑03‑20; the event date (2025‑03‑15) is the latest possible date for that registration, which we assume as the registration date.
- N1-S0 states the jersey was released on 2025‑04‑05, giving the second absolute point in time needed to compute the duration.
These two sentences together are necessary and sufficient to determine the 21‑day span.

[Sentence ID: N0-S9]
- Provides the absolute date of the season opener: October 2 (assumed 2025).
- Event date is 2025‑03‑15, which is earlier than the season opener and serves only as context.
Assumptions:
- “October 2” refers to October 2, 2025 (same calendar year as the event).
Absolute dates:
- October 2, 2025 (season opener).

[Sentence ID: N1-S7]
- Provides the absolute date of the community clinic: June 12 (assumed 2025).
- Event date is 2025‑04‑05, confirming the clinic is scheduled later in the same year.
Assumptions:
- “June 12” refers to June 12, 2025.
Absolute dates:
- June 12, 2025 (clinic).

Additional sentences:
- None needed; the two selected sentences uniquely supply the two dates required.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the duration (in days) between the clinic date (June 12) and the season‑opener date (October 2). Both dates are only present in the two selected sentences, so both are required.

[Answer derivation]:
- Compute days from June 12, 2025 to October 2, 2025.
  • June 12 → June 30 = 18 days
  • July = 31 days
  • August = 31 days
  • September = 30 days
  • October 1‑2 = 2 days

[Sentence N0-S9]:
- Provides that the club will allocate cap space to sign Maya Torres **before the season opener on October 2**. The sentence itself is part of the event dated **2025‑03‑15**, so we infer that the allocation decision (and thus the “signing” action) is being made on that event date.
- Event date: 2025‑03‑15.
Assumptions:
- The allocation/decision occurs on the same day as the event (2025‑03‑15). No other specific date is given, so we treat the event date as the reference point for the “signing” action.

[Sentence N2-S0]:
- States explicitly: **On 2025‑10‑04**, Maya Torres suffered a bruised left ankle.
- Event date: 2025‑10‑04 (the date is directly given in the sentence).

Absolute dates derived:
- Start point: 2025‑03‑15 (allocation/decision to sign Maya Torres).
- End point: 2025‑10‑04 (injury occurrence).

Compute duration:
- March 15 → March 31: 16 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 31 days
- August: 31 days

Total = 16 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 4 = **203 days**.

Problems identified:
1. The question includes absolute dates (“March 15”, “October 4”), violating the instruction to avoid absolute dates in the question.
2. The derived duration (203 days) assumes the signing decision occurred on the event date (2025‑03‑15). However, the selected sentence N0‑S9 only states that the cap space will be allocated “before the season opener on October 2”. The exact signing date is not given; the only concrete date we can infer from that sentence is the latest possible date (October 2). Therefore, the appropriate time span to compute is between the latest possible signing date (the season opener) and the injury date (October 4), which is 2 days.
3. The question should be phrased without explicit absolute dates, referencing the “season opener” and the “injury” instead.
4. No additional sentences are required beyond the two selected ones.

Corrections made:
- Revised the question to remove absolute dates and to ask for the maximum possible number of days between the latest possible signing date (the season opener) and the injury.
- Updated the answer to the correct duration: 2 days.

[Sentence N0-S7]:

- Event date for this event is 2025‑04‑05, which we treat as the date of the announcement (the latest date mentioned in the event).
Assumptions:
- The announcement occurred on the same day as the event date (2025‑04‑05). The release date mentioned (“released on April 5”) is therefore also 2025‑04‑05.
Absolute dates derived:
- Announcement / release date: 2025‑04‑05.

Assumptions:

[Sentence ID: N0-S2]
- The sentence states that the league recorded the registration of Elara Finch's extension **before** the domestic transfer deadline of 2025‑03‑20.
- Event date for this event is 2025‑03‑15 (the date shown for the <event> block).
Assumptions:
- In the absence of a more precise date, we assume the registration was recorded on the same day as the event, i.e., **2025‑03‑15**. This is a common reporting practice and the only absolute date we can reliably anchor the registration to.
Absolute dates:
- Registration (assumed) = 2025‑03‑15
- Transfer deadline (mentioned) = 2025‑03‑20 (used only to confirm that the registration indeed occurred before this deadline)

[Sentence ID: N3-S0]
- The sentence explicitly says Maya Torres completed her ankle rehabilitation program **on 2025‑10‑25**.
- Event date for this event is also 2025‑10‑25, matching the explicit date.
Assumptions:
- None needed; the date is directly given.
Absolute dates:
- Rehabilitation completion = 2025‑10‑25

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences are required. All needed absolute dates are derived from the two selected sentences (with the reasonable assumption for N0‑S2).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the number of days between the registration of Elara Finch’s extension (as recorded before the deadline) and the completion of Maya Torres’s rehabilitation program.
- The question must explicitly state the assumption that the registration occurred on the event’s date (2025‑03‑15) so that the answer is uniquely determined.
- This forces the use of both selected sentences; no other sentence in the outline provides the exact rehabilitation completion date or a comparable registration date.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start date = 2025‑03‑15
- End date   = 2025‑10‑25

**Problems identified:**
1. **Absolute date in the question:** The question explicitly mentions “March 15 2025,” which violates the instruction to avoid absolute dates in the question when possible.
2. **Potential ambiguity about the assumed date:** While the assumption is stated, it can be expressed more cleanly by referring to “the day of the event that recorded the registration” rather than naming the calendar date.

**Corrections made:**
- Re‑phrased the question to remove the explicit absolute date and instead refer to the event described in sentence N0‑S2.
- Kept the explicit assumption that the registration occurred on the same day as that event.
- Retained the answer (224 days) and confirmed that no additional sentences are required.

**Resulting reasoning:**
- From N0‑S2 we know the registration happened before 2025‑03‑20. The event date for that block is 2025‑03‑15, and per the task we may use the event date when no more precise date is given. We assume the registration occurred on that event date.
- N3‑S0 gives the exact rehabilitation completion date of 2025‑10‑25.
- Calculating the days between 2025‑03‑15 and 2025‑10‑25 yields 224 days.

All criteria are now satisfied.

- Provides a relative deadline: the signing must occur before the season opener on October 2.
- Event date is 2025‑03‑15, so the October 2 refers to October 2, 2025.
Assumptions:
- The latest possible day the signing could be completed while still satisfying “before October 2” is October 1, 2025.
Absolute date derived:
- Signing date (assumed latest possible) = 2025‑10‑01.

The original response correctly derived the dates from the two selected sentences and computed the duration (35 days). However, it omitted the required list of sentence IDs in the `<additional_sentence_ids>` field. According to the task instructions, this field must list all sentence IDs needed to answer the question (including the originally selected ones). Therefore, I add the IDs **N0‑S9** and **N3‑S8**.

The question itself already depends on both sentences and the explicit assumption about signing on the latest possible day before the October 2 deadline, which is permissible. No other changes are needed.

The corrected output now includes the required IDs and a brief explanation of why they are needed.

<question>Assuming the signing of Maya Torres is completed on the latest possible day before the October 2 deadline mentioned in the contract‑allocation sentence, how many days elapse between that signing date and the season opener scheduled for November 5, 2025?</question>
<answer>35 days</answer>
<additional_sentence_ids>N0-S9, N3-S8</additional_sentence_ids>
<additional_sentence_explanation>
- N0‑S9 provides the deadline “before the season opener on October 2,” which is needed to infer the latest possible signing date (October 1).  
- N3‑S8 gives the exact date of the season opener (“2025‑11‑05”), required to compute the interval.
These two sentences together are necessary to determine the time span; no other sentence in the outline supplies both pieces of information.

[Sentence N0-S3]:
- Provides the absolute date “March 20” (the transfer deadline) and ties it to the league’s filing of the contract under registration number MWBL‑2025‑RIV‑EF.
- Event date for this event is 2025‑03‑15, but the sentence explicitly mentions March 20, which we interpret as 2025‑03‑20.
Assumptions:
- The contract filing occurred on the deadline day itself (2025‑03‑20). The sentence states “confirming compliance … on March 20,” which we take to mean the filing was completed by that date, i.e., on that date.
Absolute date derived: 2025‑03‑20 (no specific time; assume start of day).

[Sentence N4-S0]:
- Gives the exact time of the opening tip‑off: 7:00 PM on the season‑opening game.
- The event date for this event is 2025‑11‑05, so the absolute timestamp is 2025‑11‑05 19:00.
Assumptions:
- The tip‑off occurred at the stated time on the event date.
Absolute timestamp derived: 2025‑11‑05 19:00.

Duration calculation:
- From 2025‑03‑20 00:00 to 2025‑11‑05 19:00.
- Days between 2025‑03‑20 and 2025‑11‑05 = 230 days (as computed by summing remaining days in March (11) + full months Apr‑Oct (214) + first 5 days of Nov (5) = 230).
- Adding the 19 hours gives 230 days 19 hours, but the question will ask only for whole days to avoid reliance on the assumed midnight time.

Thus the required duration is **230 days**.

Problems identified:
1. **Absolute dates in the question** – The task explicitly asks to avoid including absolute dates or times in the question. The original question mentions “on March 20” and “on November 5”, which violates this rule.
2. **Clarity of required information** – The question should refer to the events described in the selected sentences (the contract filing that confirmed compliance with the transfer deadline, and the opening tip‑off at 7:00 PM) without stating the dates, so that the dates must be extracted from the sentences.
3. **Answer precision** – The calculation of 230 days is correct when measuring from the start of March 20 to the start of November 5. Since the question now asks for “how many days elapsed”, reporting the whole‑day count (230 days) is appropriate and matches the derived duration.

Corrections made:
- Re‑phrased the question to remove explicit dates while still uniquely referencing the two selected sentences.
- Kept the answer unchanged at “230 days” because the duration remains the same.
- No additional sentences are required; the selected sentences alone provide all needed information.

The revised output follows the required format.

[Sentence N0-S9]:
- Provides the latest permissible signing date: “before the season opener on October 2.” This gives a concrete calendar date (October 2, 2025) for the season opener, which we will treat as the signing date for calculation (the latest possible day the signing could occur).
- Event date: 2025‑03‑15 (the overall event containing this sentence). The October 2 date is later in the same year, so we interpret it as October 2, 2025.

[Sentence N4-S0]:
- Gives the exact time of the opening tip‑off: “at 7:00 PM.” The event date for this sentence is 2025‑11‑05, so the tip‑off occurs at 7:00 PM on November 5, 2025.

Assumptions:
- The signing of Maya Torres happens on the latest permissible day, i.e., on October 2, 2025 (midnight 00:00 for simplicity).
- No additional time of day is specified for the signing, so we treat it as occurring at the start of that day.

Absolute dates derived:
- Signing: 2025‑10‑02 00:00.
- Tip‑off: 2025‑11‑05 19:00.

Duration calculation:
- From 2025‑10‑02 00:00 to 2025‑11‑05 00:00 = 34 days? Actually October has 31 days: 31‑02 = 29 days; plus 4 full days of November (1‑4) = 33 days.
- Add 19 hours on November 5 to reach 19:00 → total = 33 days + 19 hours.

Answer: 33 days and 19 hours.

Problems identified:
1. The original question assumes the signing occurs on the season‑opener date but does not specify the time of day. Since the sentence N0‑S9 only gives a date (October 2) with no time, the answer depends on an implicit assumption about the signing time. The task requires that any assumptions be explicitly stated in the question.
2. To make the answer unambiguous, the question must state that the signing is considered to happen at the start of the day (00:00) on October 2. This aligns with the assumption used in the derivation (signing at midnight).

Corrections made:
- Updated the question to explicitly include the assumption that the signing occurs at 00:00 on the season‑opener date.
- No additional sentences are required; the two selected sentences remain sufficient.

[Sentence N0-S2]:
- Provides that the league recorded the registration before the domestic transfer deadline of 2025‑03‑20.
- The event date for the whole outline is 2025‑03‑15, which is the latest date on which anything in the event could have occurred. Since the registration is known to have happened before 2025‑03‑20 and the event’s latest date is 2025‑03‑15, we infer that the registration was recorded on 2025‑03‑15.
Assumptions:
- The registration was recorded on the event date (2025‑03‑15) because no later date is mentioned and the event date is the latest possible date for actions described in the event.
Absolute dates:
- Registration date inferred as 2025‑03‑15.

[Sentence N0-S7]:
- States that the limited‑edition jersey will be released on April 5 (no year given, but context is the same 2025 season).
Assumptions:
- The release year is 2025, matching the event’s year.
Absolute dates:
- Jersey release date = 2025‑04‑05.

Additional sentences:
- None needed; the two selected sentences together provide all required dates.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the number of days between the registration (derived from N0‑S2 and the event date) and the jersey release (from N0‑S7). Both sentences are essential: N0‑S2 gives the registration’s latest possible day, N0‑S7 gives the release day.

[Answer derivation]:
- From 2025‑03‑15 to 2025‑04‑05:
  * March has 31 days → 31 − 15 = 16 days remaining in March.
  * Add 5 days of April → 16 + 5 = 21 days.

Problems identified:
1. **Missing explicit assumption** – The original question asks for the number of days between two specific days, but the registration day is not directly given in the selected sentence N0‑S2. It only states the registration occurred “before the domestic transfer deadline of 2025‑03‑20.” The answer (21 days) relies on the assumption that the registration happened on the event date (2025‑03‑15), which was not stated in the question.
2. **Question does not reference the needed assumption** – Because the assumption is omitted, the question could be considered ambiguous and therefore not fully compliant with the instruction that any required assumptions must be made explicit in the question.
3. **No violation of other criteria** – The selected sentences are still the only sources of the required dates, and no additional sentences are needed.

Corrections made:
- Revised the question to explicitly state the assumption that the registration was recorded on the event date (the latest date mentioned in the outline). This keeps the question free of absolute dates while making the necessary assumption clear.
- Kept the answer unchanged (21 days) because, under the stated assumption, the calculation remains correct.

[Sentence ID: N1-S0]:
- Provides the exact calendar date of the jersey release: 2025-04-05.
- Event date for this event is 2025-04-05 (the same as the specific sub‑event date).

[Sentence ID: N2-S0]:
- Provides the exact calendar date of Maya Torres’s ankle injury: 2025-10-04.
- Event date for this event is 2025-10-04 (the same as the specific sub‑event date).

Assumptions:
- Both dates are absolute and require no further inference; the event dates coincide with the sub‑event dates given in the sentences.

Absolute dates:
- Jersey release: 5 April 2025.
- Injury occurrence: 4 October 2025.

Computation:
- Days remaining in April after the 5th: 25 (April 6‑30).
- Full months between May and September: May 31 + June 30 + July 31 + August 31 + September 30 = 153.
- Days in October up to the 4th: 4.
- Total elapsed days = 25 + 153 + 4 = **182 days**.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the elapsed time (in days) between the two events described in the selected sentences. Both sentences are required because each supplies one of the two absolute dates; no other sentence in the outline provides either of these dates.

[Answer derivation]:
- Using the absolute dates derived above, the interval from 2025‑04‑05 to 2025‑10‑04 is 182 days.

The original response correctly follows the task instructions:

- It extracts absolute dates from the two selected sentences (2025‑04‑05 and 2025‑10‑04) and computes the interval as 182 days.
- The question does not mention any absolute dates, requiring the reader to locate the dates in the provided sentences.
- Both selected sentences are necessary; no other sentence in the outline provides these dates.
- No additional sentences are needed, so the additional_sentence_ids field is appropriately empty.
- The answer is a concise duration (“182 days”) without extra wording.

No discrepancies or missing elements were found, so no corrections are required.

- Provides the day and month of the clinic: June 12. No year is given.
- Event date for this event is 2025‑04‑05, indicating the surrounding context is in the year 2025.
Assumptions:
- The “June 12 clinic” occurs in the same calendar year as the event (2025), i.e., June 12 2025.
Absolute date derived: 2025‑06‑12.

Problems identified:
1. The question includes an explicit year (“2025”), which the instructions ask to avoid if possible. The year can be omitted because the selected sentences already imply the same year.
2. The question states the exact date “October 4, 2025”. While the date is needed for the calculation, the instruction is to avoid providing absolute dates directly in the question; instead, refer to the date as given in the selected sentence (e.g., “the injury that occurred on October 4” without the year, or simply “the injury date mentioned in the second selected sentence”).
3. No other issues: the answer (114 days) is correct, all selected sentences are required, and no extra sentences are needed.

Corrections made:
- Revised the question to remove the explicit year, keeping only month‑day references, and phrased the assumption about the year implicitly.
- Kept the answer unchanged.
- Confirmed that no additional sentence IDs are required.

The corrected response follows the required format.

[Sentence N1-S9]:
- Provides the scheduled shipping date of the supplemental 2,000 jerseys: **May 3, 2025**.
- Event date is 2025‑04‑05, but the sentence itself states the absolute future date (May 3, 2025), which we use directly.

[Sentence N3-S2]:
- Provides the season‑opener date for Maya Torres: **2025‑11‑05**.
- Event date is 2025‑10‑25, but the sentence explicitly gives the absolute date (Nov 5, 2025), which we use directly.

Assumptions:
- Both dates are calendar dates in the Gregorian calendar.
- The duration is measured in whole days from the shipping date (May 3) up to but not including the season‑opener date (Nov 5). Standard date‑difference calculation is applied.

Absolute dates:
- Shipping date: 2025‑05‑03
- Season‑opener date: 2025‑11‑05

Computation:
- Days remaining in May after the 3rd: 31 − 3 = 28

[Sentence N1-S0]:
- Provides an absolute calendar date for the jersey release: **2025‑04‑05**. No time of day is given, so we treat the event as occurring at the start of that day (00:00).
- Event date for this event is 2025‑04‑05, matching the explicit date.

[Sentence N4-S0]:
- Describes the opening tip‑off of the season game and gives a specific clock time: **7:00 PM**. The event header for this event is **2025‑11‑05**, which is the latest date for all actions in that event, so we infer the tip‑off occurred on **2025‑11‑05 at 19:00**.
- No other sentence provides the date of the tip‑off, so the event date is required to anchor the time.

Assumptions:
- The jersey release occurred at the beginning of the day (00:00) on 2025‑04‑05 because no time is specified.
- The tip‑off occurred on the same day as the event date (2025‑11‑05) at the stated time 7:00 PM.

Absolute dates/times:
- Start: 2025‑04‑05 00:00.
- End:   2025‑11‑05 19:00.

Duration calculation:
- Days from 2025‑04‑05 to 2025‑11‑05 = 214 days.
- Additional hours from 00:00 to 19:00 = 19 hours.
- Total duration = **214 days and 19 hours**.

Question Idea:
Create a question that asks for the elapsed time between the jersey release (identified only by the sentence that mentions the release date) and the season‑opening tip‑off (identified only by the sentence that mentions the tip‑off time, with the date inferred from the event header). The question must not state any dates or times explicitly, forcing the answerer to extract them from the two selected sentences.

The task requires any assumptions to be clearly stated in the question.
2. **No need for additional sentence IDs** – The selected sentences (N1‑S0 and N4‑S0) together with the event dates already provide all required information, so no extra sentences are needed.

  * November 1 → November 5: 5 days
  * Total full days = 28+30+31+31+30+31+5 = **186 days**
- Add the time from midnight to 19:00 on the final day: **19 hours**.
- Resulting duration = **186 days 19 hours**.

Question Idea:
Create a question that asks for the elapsed time between the scheduled shipping of the additional jerseys (date only) and the opening tip‑off of the season‑opening game (date + time). The question must require the shipping date (from N1‑S9) and the tip‑off time (from N4‑S0) and cannot be answered without both pieces of information.

Answer derivation:
Using the absolute dates derived above, the elapsed time is 186 days and 19 hours.

The previous response correctly follows the task instructions:
- It derives absolute dates from the selected sentences, using the event date where necessary.
- The question avoids mentioning explicit dates, referencing only “the scheduled shipping date” and “the tip‑off day,” thus requiring the selected sentences to resolve the dates.
- Both selected sentences are essential: N1‑S9 provides the shipping date (May 3, 2025) and N4‑S0 provides the tip‑off time (7:00 PM) plus the event date (2025‑11‑05) is used as the tip‑off day.
- No other sentences in the outline can supply the same information, so the answer cannot be derived without both selected sentences.
- The assumption that shipment occurs at midnight is explicitly stated in the question.
- The computed duration (186 days 19 hours) is correct.

No changes are needed.

[Sentence ID]: N1-S0
- Time information: Provides an absolute release date of the limited‑edition jersey: **2025‑04‑05**.
- Event date: The event containing this sentence is dated 2025‑04‑05, which aligns with the release date (the event date is the latest date for that event).

[Sentence ID]: N1‑S9
- Time information: Provides an absolute scheduled shipping date for the supplemental 2,000 jerseys: **2025‑05‑03**.
- Event date: The event containing this sentence is dated 2025‑04‑05, but the sentence itself specifies a future date (May 3, 2025).

Assumptions:
- Both dates are exact calendar dates; no time‑of‑day is needed for day‑level duration.
- The duration is calculated as the number of full days from the release date (April 5) up to but not including the shipping date (May 3). This is the standard difference between two dates.

Absolute dates:
- Release date: 2025‑04‑05
- Shipping date: 2025‑05‑03

Additional sentences:
- None required. The two selected sentences contain all necessary absolute dates.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the number of days that elapse between the release of the limited‑edition jersey and the scheduled shipping of the supplemental run. This requires extracting both dates from the two selected sentences; no other sentence provides either date.

[Answer derivation]:
- Days in April after the 5th: 30 − 5 = 25 days.
- Add the first 3 days of May: 25 + 3 = 28 days.
- Therefore, the duration is **28 days**.

- Event date for this event is 2025‑04‑05, but the shipping date is explicitly given as May 3, 2025, which is after the event date.
Assumptions:
- The year of the shipping date is the same as the event year (2025), as no other year is mentioned.
Absolute dates:
- Shipping date = 2025‑05‑03.

[Sentence ID]: N1-S7
- Provides the date of the community basketball clinic that Elara Finch will lead: June 12 (year not stated, but inferred to be 2025 because the event occurs in 2025 and no other year is indicated).
- Event date for this event is 2025‑04‑05; the clinic is a future event within the same year.
Assumptions:

[Sentence N2-S0]:
- Provides absolute date of the injury: **2025-10-04** (explicitly stated as “On 2025-10-04”).
- Event date for this event is also 2025-10-04, matching the injury date.

[Sentence N3-S2]:
- Describes a roster update that confirms Maya Torres will start in the season opener on **2025-11-05**.  
- The event containing this sentence is dated **2025-10-25**. Since the sentence reports the release of the roster update, we assume the update was released on the event date (2025-10-25).

Assumptions:
- The roster update mentioned in N3‑S2 was released on the event date of that entry (2025‑10‑25). This is a standard interpretation: the content of an event is reported on the event’s date unless a different date is explicitly given.
- No other sentence in the outline provides the specific combination “roster update confirming Maya Torres’s starting‑lineup status,” so N3‑S2 is the only source for that information.

Absolute dates derived:
- Injury date: 2025‑10‑04
- Roster‑update release date: 2025‑10‑25

Duration calculation:
- From 2025‑10‑04 to 2025‑10‑25 is **21 days**.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the number of days that elapsed between the injury and the release of the roster update that confirmed her starting‑lineup status. This requires both N2‑S0 (injury date) and N3‑S2 (roster‑update release date). No other sentence supplies the unique “roster update” information, ensuring all selected sentences are necessary.

**Problems identified**
1. **Missing explicit assumption** – The question asks for the number of days between the injury and the release of the roster update, but the selected sentence N3‑S2 does not state the release date. The answer relies on the assumption that the roster update was released on the event’s date (2025‑10‑25). The original question did not mention this required assumption, which violates the instruction to state any assumptions clearly in the question.
2. **No other issues** – The question does not contain absolute dates, uses only the two selected sentences, and the answer (21 days) is correct given the assumption.

**Corrections made**
- Revised the question to explicitly state the needed assumption: that the roster update was released on the same day as the event reporting it.
- Kept the answer unchanged (21 days) and retained no additional sentence IDs, as the original selected sentences are sufficient.

2. N2‑S2 (prescribed “minimum of two weeks” rest) & N4‑S0 (game tip‑off at 7:00 PM on 2025‑11‑05). → Requires adding the two‑week interval to the injury date (2025‑10‑04) to obtain 2025‑10‑18, then measuring to 2025‑11‑05 19:00. This also yields a valid span (18 days 19 hours).
3. N2‑S0 & N4‑S4 (full 40‑minute play after rehabilitation). → N4‑S4 does not contain an explicit time, only that she played the full game; cannot derive a concrete point without the game start time.

[Sentence ID: N2-S2]
- Provides a prescribed minimum rest period of two weeks for Maya Torres after her ankle injury.
- The event containing this sentence is dated 2025-10-04, which we treat as the date of the injury and the start of the rest period.
Assumptions:
- The two‑week rest begins on the injury date (2025‑10‑04) and ends exactly 14 days later, i.e., at the start of 2025‑10‑18.
Absolute dates:
- Start of rest: 2025‑10‑04
- Earliest possible return (end of minimum rest): 2025‑10‑18

[Sentence ID: N4-S0]
- States that the opening tip‑off occurred at 7:00 PM on the day of the event.
- The event date is 2025-11-05, so the tip‑off time is 2025‑11‑05 19:00.

Assumptions:
- No additional time offset; the tip‑off is exactly at 19:00 on 2025‑11‑05.

Derived duration:
- From the start of 2025‑10‑18 to 2025‑11‑05 19:00 is 18 days and 19 hours.
- If expressed in whole days (ignoring the hour component), the elapsed time is 18 days.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the number of days elapsed between the earliest day Maya Torres could resume full activity (based on the two‑week minimum rest) and the opening tip‑off of the season. This requires both the rest‑period information (N2‑S2) and the tip‑off date/time (N4‑S0). No other sentences provide both pieces of information.

Answer derivation:
- Injury date = 2025‑10‑04 (event date).
- Minimum rest = 14 days → earliest return = 2025‑10‑18.
- Tip‑off = 2025‑11‑05.
- Days between 2025‑10‑18 and 2025‑11‑05 = 18 days.

**Problems identified in the original response**

1. **Uniqueness of required sentences**  
   - The original question asked only for the number of full days between the earliest possible return day and the opening tip‑off.  
   - The date of the opening tip‑off (2025‑11‑05) is also provided by sentence **N3‑S2** (“...starting lineup for the season opener on 2025‑11‑05”), which is not among the selected sentences.  
   - Therefore the question could be answered without using **N4‑S0**, violating the requirement that *all* selected sentences be necessary and that *no other* sentence in the complete outline can replace any selected sentence.

2. **Insufficient use of the time component**  
   - Sentence **N4‑S0** contains the specific time “7:00 PM”. The original question ignored this detail, again making the time‑specific sentence replaceable.

3. **Answer format**  
   - The answer “18 days” is correct for full days, but because the question should now require the time component, the answer must include hours (or an equivalent unit).

**Corrections made**

- Revised the question to require the exact elapsed time **including hours**, referencing the 7:00 PM tip‑off. This forces the use of the time information unique to **N4‑S0**.
- Updated the answer to “18 days and 19 hours”, which reflects the interval from the start of 2025‑10‑18 (00:00) to 2025‑11‑05 19:00.
- Added a brief explanation of the assumptions used (rest starts on the injury date, earliest return day begins at 00:00).

The selected sentences remain the same; no additional sentences are needed.

Potential sentence pairs:

1. **N2-S0 & N2-S2**  
   - N2-S0 gives a concrete date: “On 2025-10-04 …”.  
   - N2-S2 states a prescribed “minimum of two weeks” of rest.  
   - From the injury date we can compute the earliest allowed return date (2025-10-04 + 14 days = 2025-10-18). This yields a clear 14‑day span.

2. **N2-S0 & N2-S4**  
   - N2-S0 provides the injury date (2025-10-04).  
   - N2-S4 says minutes will be limited “for the remainder of the season’s opening month.”  
   - Assuming the opening month is October, the remainder runs from 2025-10-04 through 2025-10-31, giving a span of 27 days.

Both pairs satisfy the requirement of deriving a meaningful absolute duration from two distinct sentences.

[Sentence ID]: N2-S0
- Provides the absolute date of the injury: 2025-10-04.
- Event date is also 2025-10-04, confirming this is the latest date for the described sub‑event.

[Sentence ID]: N2-S2
- States the prescribed rest period: “a minimum of two weeks.”
- No additional absolute dates are given; the duration must be added to the injury date from N2‑S0.

Assumptions:
- “Two weeks” is interpreted as exactly 14 calendar days.
- The rest period starts on the day of the injury (2025‑10‑04) and the minimum end date is therefore 2025‑10‑18.

Absolute dates derived:
- Injury date: 2025‑10‑04 (from N2‑S0)
- Earliest possible end of minimum rest: 2025‑10‑18 (2025‑10‑04 + 14 days)

Question Idea:
- Ask for the minimum number of days Maya Torres must remain out of full competition, requiring the reader to combine the injury date (N2‑S0) with the prescribed “minimum of two weeks” (N2‑S2). No other sentence provides both pieces of information, so both selected sentences are necessary.

Answer derivation:
- Two weeks = 14 days. Therefore the minimum rest duration is 14 days.

Problems identified:
1. The original question asked only for the minimum number of days of rest, which can be answered solely from sentence N2‑S2 (“minimum of two weeks”). The injury date from N2‑S0 is unnecessary, violating the requirement that **all selected sentences must be needed**.
2. Because the date information was not required, the question did not truly depend on both sentences, failing the “ALL selected sentences are required” criterion.
3. The question should therefore be re‑phrased to require both the injury date (from N2‑S0) **and** the prescribed two‑week rest (from N2‑S2) to compute a duration.

Correction made:
- Revised the question to ask for the number of days **between** the injury date and the earliest possible day Maya Torres could return to full competition, which explicitly needs both the injury date and the two‑week rest period.
- The answer remains 14 days, as the duration between Oct 4 2025 and Oct 18 2025 (injury date + 14 days) is 14 days.
- No additional sentences beyond the originally selected ones are required, so `additional_sentence_ids` stays empty.

The corrected QA now satisfies all task criteria.

Ideas for distractor:
- 12 days (confusing 12‑minute per quarter limit with days)
- 10 days (thinking two weeks = 10 business days)
- 7 days (thinking “minimum two weeks” as one week)
- 21 days (thinking “minimum two weeks” means at least three weeks)

Choose 12 days because N2‑S4 mentions “12‑minute cap per quarter”, which can be misread as 12 days. Use N2‑S0 for injury date and N2‑S4 for the 12‑minute limit to make it plausible.

[Sentence N2-S0]:
- Provides absolute date of the injury: 2025‑10‑04.
- Event date is also 2025‑10‑04 (the same day).

[Sentence N2-S4]:
- States that the minute limitation applies for “the remainder of the season’s opening month.”
- No explicit calendar date; we must infer which month is the opening month.

Assumptions:
- The season’s opening month is the calendar month in which the season opener occurs.
- The season opener date is given in sentence N0‑S9 (“before the season opener on October 2”).
- Therefore the opening month is October 2025, running from 2025‑10‑01 (or 2025‑10‑02) through 2025‑10‑31.
- “Remainder of the opening month” after the injury on 2025‑10‑04 means the days from 2025‑10‑05 through 2025‑10‑31 inclusive.

Absolute dates derived:
- Injury date: 2025‑10‑04.
- End of opening month: 2025‑10‑31.
- Number of full days remaining after the injury: 27 days (Oct 5‑Oct 31).

Additional sentence needed:
- N0‑S9: “... before the season opener on October 2.” This supplies the month (October) of the season’s opening month, which is essential to identify the correct calendar month for the “remainder” calculation.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the number of days the quarter‑minute limitation will remain in effect, i.e., the length of the remainder of the opening month after the injury. The question must reference the injury event and the “remainder of the opening month” limitation without stating the dates, forcing the solver to extract the injury date (N2‑S0), the month of the opening month (via N0‑S9), and the limitation statement (N2‑S4).

Answer derivation:
- End of opening month = 2025‑10‑31.
- Injury date = 2025‑10‑04.
- Full days after injury = 2025‑10‑31 – 2025‑10‑04 = 27 days.

**Problems identified:**
1. **Missing required sentence IDs:** The `<additional_sentence_ids>` field only listed `N0-S9`. However, the question also relies on the selected sentences `N2-S0` (injury date) and `N2-S4` (restriction for the remainder of the opening month). According to the instructions, the list should include *all* sentence IDs needed to answer the question, including the originally selected ones.
2. **Explanation clarity:** The explanation correctly describes why `N0-S9` is needed, but it should also note that `N2-S0` provides the injury date and `N2-S4` provides the “remainder of the opening month” clause, both of which are essential.
3. **No other issues:** The question does not contain absolute dates, the answer is concise, and the reasoning remains valid.

**Corrections made:**
- Updated `<additional_sentence_ids>` to include `N2-S0`, `N2-S4`, and `N0-S9`.

[Sentence N3-S0]:
- Provides the exact calendar date when Maya Torres completed her ankle rehabilitation: **2025‑10‑25**.
- Event date for this event is also **2025‑10‑25**, confirming the date is accurate.
- No time of day is given; we assume the completion (or announcement) occurred at the start of that day (00:00).

[Sentence N4-S0]:
- States that the opening tip‑off occurred **at 7:00 PM**.
- The event date for this event is **2025‑11‑05**, so the tip‑off happened on **2025‑11‑05 at 19:00**.
- This provides both the date and the specific time, which is not available elsewhere in the outline.

Assumptions:
- The rehabilitation completion is taken as occurring at 00:00 on 2025‑10‑25 (midnight start of the day), because no time is specified.
- No daylight‑saving changes affect the interval between the two dates.

Absolute dates/times:
- Start: 2025‑10‑25 00:00
- End:   2025‑11‑05 19:00

Computation:
- From 2025‑10‑25 00:00 to 2025‑11‑05 00:00 = 11 full days.
- From 2025‑11‑05 00:00 to 2025‑11‑05 19:00 = 19 hours.
- Total interval = **11 days 19 hours**.

Question Idea:
Create a question that asks for the exact duration (days and hours) between the rehabilitation completion and the opening tip‑off, explicitly requiring the 7:00 PM time. This forces the use of both selected sentences; the date alone could be obtained from other sentences, but the specific time can only be derived from N4‑S0.

Using the dates and times above, the interval is 11 days and 19 hours.

N3-S7:
- Provides the date of the fan meet‑and‑greet: “on November 3”.
- Event date is 2025‑10‑25, which is before November 3, so the November 3 refers to 2025‑11‑03.
- No time of day is given; we will assume the meet‑and‑greet starts at 12:00 PM (noon) as stated in the question.

N4-S0:
- Provides the exact time of the opening tip‑off broadcast: “at 7:00 PM”.
- The event date for this sentence is 2025‑11‑05, and other sentences confirm the tip‑off occurs on that date. Thus the broadcast time is 2025‑11‑05 19:00.

Assumptions:
- The fan meet‑and‑greet began at 12:00 PM (noon) on 2025‑11‑03, as explicitly stated in the question.

Absolute dates/times:
- Start: 2025‑11‑03 12:00 PM.

- The question does not contain explicit year information, satisfying the “avoid absolute dates” guideline while still referencing the necessary dates.
- The assumption about the meet‑and‑greet start time (12:00 PM) is clearly stated in the question.
- Both selected sentences are essential: N3‑S7 provides the November 3 date, and N4‑S0 provides the 7:00 PM time on the season‑opening day.
- No other sentence in the complete outline can supply either the November 3 date or the 7:00 PM time, so the answer cannot be derived without both selected sentences.
- The computed duration (55 hours) is correctly derived from the assumed start time and the known tip‑off time.

Since the response meets all criteria, no corrections are needed.

[Sentence N3-S0]:
- Provides the exact calendar date when Maya Torres completed her ankle rehabilitation program: **2025‑10‑25**.
- Event date for this entry is also 2025‑10‑25, confirming the date is absolute.

[Sentence N3‑S2]:
- States the calendar date of the season opener for which Maya Torres will be in the starting lineup: **2025‑11‑05**.
- The roster update was released on the event date 2025‑10‑25, but the date of the game is explicitly given as 2025‑11‑05.

Assumptions:
- No additional relative time expressions are needed; both sentences contain absolute dates.
- The dates are interpreted as calendar dates in the Gregorian calendar.

Absolute dates derived:
- Rehabilitation completion: 2025‑10‑25
- Season‑opener start: 2025‑11‑05

Computation:
- From 2025‑10‑25 to 2025‑11‑05 is 11 days (Oct 26‑31 = 6 days, Nov 1‑5 = 5 days; 6 + 5 = 11).

Question Idea:
- Ask for the duration (in days) between the day Maya Torres finished her rehab and the day she is scheduled to start in the season opener. This requires both the rehab‑completion date (N3‑S0) and the season‑opener date (N3‑S2); no other sentence provides either date.

Answer derivation:
- Using the two absolute dates above, the interval is 11 days.

**Issues identified:**
- The original question asked for the duration between rehab completion (2025‑10‑25) and the season‑opener start (2025‑11‑05).  
- The season‑opener date and the fact that Maya Torres will start are also mentioned in sentence **N3‑S8**. Therefore, sentence **N3‑S2** is *not* strictly required to answer the question, violating the instruction that *all* selected sentences must be necessary and that *no other* sentence can replace any of them.

**Correction made:**
- Revised the question to require the *date of the roster update* (the event date of the N3‑S2 entry), which is unique to that sentence.  
- The new question asks for the number of days between Maya Torres completing her rehabilitation (N3‑S0) and the club *releasing* the official roster update (N3‑S2). Both dates are explicitly the same (the event date 2025‑10‑25), so the answer is **0 days**.
- This formulation ensures that both selected sentences are essential and that no other sentence in the outline can replace either of them.

**Derivation of dates:**
- **N3‑S0**: “...completed her ankle rehabilitation program on 2025‑10‑25.” → rehab completion date = 2025‑10‑25.
- **N3‑S2**: The roster update is part of the event dated 2025‑10‑25, so the release date = 2025‑10‑25.
- Duration = 0 days (same calendar day).

**Resulting QA pair meets all task criteria.**

[Sentence N3-S7]:
- Provides the date of a fan meet‑and‑greet: “on November 3”.
- Event date for this block is 2025‑10‑25, which is earlier than the November 3 mentioned, so the November 3 refers to 2025‑11‑03.
Assumptions:
- The month “November” without a year is understood to be the same year as the surrounding event (2025).
Absolute date derived: 2025‑11‑03.

[Sentence N3‑S2]:
- States that a roster update confirms Maya Torres will be in the starting lineup for the season opener “on 2025‑11‑05”.
- The explicit year is given, so the date is 2025‑11‑05.
Assumptions:
- None needed; the date is explicit.
Absolute date derived: 2025‑11‑05.

Additional sentences:
- No additional sentences are required. N3‑S2 uniquely provides the fact that Maya Torres is listed in the starting lineup for the season opener, which cannot be inferred from any other sentence. N3‑S7 uniquely provides the November 3 fan meet‑and‑greet date.

Question Idea:
- Ask for the time span between the fan meet‑and‑greet (date from N3‑S7) and the day Maya Torres is confirmed to be in the starting lineup for the season opener (date from N3‑S2). Both sentences are essential: one supplies the earlier date, the other supplies the later date and the specific condition (being listed in the starting lineup). No other sentence in the outline gives both pieces of information together.

[Answer derivation]:
- Start date: 2025‑11‑03 (fan meet‑and‑greet).

[Sentence N4-S0]:
- Provides the exact time of the opening tip‑off: 7:00 PM.

Assumptions:
- The tip‑off occurred on the same calendar day as the event date (2025‑11‑05) at 19:00.
Absolute date/time:
- Start point = 2025‑11‑05 19:00.

[Sentence N4-S4]:
- States that Maya Torres played the full 40 minutes of the game.
- No explicit clock time is given, but a standard women's basketball game lasts 40 minutes of game time, starting at the tip‑off.
Assumptions:

**Problems identified:**
1. **Missing explicit assumption in the question:**

2. **Additional sentence IDs field left empty:**  
   The output format expects a list of sentence IDs that are required to answer the question. While the original instruction distinguishes “additional” sentences, it is clearer to list the IDs of the sentences that provide the essential information (the selected ones) to avoid ambiguity.

3. **Explanation of why each sentence is needed is absent:**  
   The `additional_sentence_explanation` field should explain the unique contribution of each required sentence.

[Sentence N4-S0]:
- Provides absolute time: the opening tip‑off occurred at 7:00 PM on the date of the event.
- Event date is 2025-11-05, which is the latest date for this event, so the tip‑off time is 2025-11-05 19:00.

[Sentence N4-S7]:
- States that net proceeds are earmarked for “the upcoming June community clinic.”
- No specific day is given; only the month (June) is mentioned. To obtain an exact date we must rely on another sentence in the outline.

[Additional Sentence N1-S7]:
- Gives the exact date of the clinic: “June 12 clinic.”
- Therefore the clinic occurs on 2025-06-12. No time of day is specified; we assume the clinic starts at 00:00 on that date (the earliest possible moment on that day).

Assumptions:
- The June community clinic referenced in N4‑S7 is the same clinic mentioned in N1‑S7 (June 12, 2025). This is a reasonable link because both sentences refer to “the upcoming June community clinic” and N1‑S7 is the only sentence that supplies a concrete day in June.
- The clinic’s start time is taken as midnight (00:00) on 2025‑06‑12 because no time is provided.

Absolute dates:
- Clinic start: 2025‑06‑12 00:00.
- Opening tip‑off: 2025‑11‑05 19:00.

Duration calculation:
- Days from 2025‑06‑12 to 2025‑11‑05 = 146 days (18 days in June after the 12th, plus full months July‑Oct, plus 5 days in November).
- Additional hours from 00:00 to 19:00 on the final day = 19 hours.
- Total elapsed time = 146 days 19 hours.

Question Idea:
Create a question that requires:
1. The exact date of the June clinic (from N1‑S7).
2. The exact time of the opening tip‑off (from N4‑S0).
Both selected sentences are needed, and the additional sentence N1‑S7 is essential to resolve the clinic’s day. No other sentences provide the June 12 date, so the question cannot be answered without all three.

Using the dates above, the elapsed time is 146 days 19 hours.

I need one plausible but incorrect distractor for the elapsed time between the clinic start (midnight June 12) and the tip‑off (7:00 PM Nov 5). A common mistake could be assuming the clinic starts at noon instead of midnight, which would give 146 days, 7 hours (since 12:00 PM to 7:00 PM is 7 h). This uses the clinic date from N1‑S7 and the tip‑off time from N4‑S0, and N4‑S7 mentions the June clinic, making the misinterpretation believable.

I examined all sentences that mention Elara Finch.  
From the first event, sentences N0‑S0, S1, S2, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8 all contain her name.  
From the second event, sentences N1‑S0, S6, S7 contain her name.  

To satisfy the requirement of using both events, I need one sentence from each event.  
I looked for a pair where each sentence provides a distinct piece of information that must be combined to answer a question, and where that information is not duplicated elsewhere or inferable from the knowledge‑base entries.

- **N0‑S8**: States that the reduced salary from Elara Finch’s contract extension frees cap space to sign a backup shooting guard before the season opener.  
- **N1‑S7**: Quotes Elara Finch saying she will “lead a shooting‑drills workshop” at the community basketball clinic.

These two sentences together allow a multi‑hop question such as:  
*“What position is the player that will be signed using the cap space saved by Elara Finch’s contract extension, and what specific activity will Elara Finch perform at the community clinic?”*  

Answering requires linking the cap‑space‑freeing contract detail (backup shooting guard) with Elara’s role at the clinic (lead a shooting‑drills workshop). No other sentence pair provides this combination, and the information cannot be derived from the static knowledge‑base entries.

Thus the pair N0‑S8 and N1‑S7 is the most suitable.

Sentence information: 
- N0-S8: The club says the reduced salary allocation from Elara Finch's extension frees cap space to sign a backup shooting guard before the season opener. Unique identifier: the player whose contract freed cap space for a backup shooting guard.
- N1-S7: Elara Finch states she will share skills at the June 12 clinic and will lead a shooting‑drills workshop. Unique detail: the clinic is on June 12.

Idea: Ask for the date of the clinic where the player (identified via the contract‑freeing‑cap‑space detail) will lead a shooting‑drills workshop.

Additional sentences: None needed; both required details are present in the selected sentences.

Verification:
- The bridge entity is paraphrased using info from N0‑S8, not named directly.
- Answer (June 12) comes from N1‑S7.
- Both sentences are required to resolve the question.

- N0‑S8: Elara Finch’s contract freed cap space for a backup shooting guard.
- N1‑S7: Elara Finch will lead a shooting‑drills workshop at the June 12 clinic.

Created false‑premise questions by altering one detail each:
1. Change the player (Maya Torres) – contradicts N0‑S8.
2. Change the clinic date (July 5) – contradicts N1‑S7.
3. Change the workshop type (defensive‑drills) – contradicts N1‑S7.
4. Change the position the cap space is for (starting point guard) – contradicts N0‑S8.
Each question keeps the overall structure of the original question.

I listed all sentence IDs that contain the bridge entity “Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club”.  
From the first event, the most relevant sentence for a multi‑hop link is **N0‑S8**, which states that the club’s reduced salary for Elara Finch frees **$12,000** of cap space that will be used to sign veteran guard **Maya Torres**.  

From the second event, a sentence that provides a distinct fact about Maya Torres after she has been signed is **N2‑S4**, where Coach Dana Loris announces that Maya Torres’ playing minutes will be limited to **twelve minutes per quarter** (a maximum of 48 minutes per game) due to her ankle injury.  

These two sentences together allow a question that requires reasoning across the two events: the amount of cap space freed to sign Maya Torres and the subsequent playing‑time restriction imposed on her. The information (cap‑space amount and injury‑related minute limit) does not appear elsewhere in the knowledge base or other sentences, making the pair uniquely suitable for a multi‑hop question involving the bridge entity.

Sentence information: 
- N0-S8: The club (Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club) announced that reduced salary allocation from Elara Finch's extension frees cap space to sign a backup shooting guard before the season opener.
- N2-S4: Coach Dana Loris of the same club announced that Maya Torres will have playing minutes limited to twelve per quarter for the remainder of the season’s opening month.

Idea: Ask which player’s minutes are limited, referencing the club that announced the freed cap space. This requires linking the coach’s statement (player name) to the club identified by the cap‑space announcement.

Additional sentences: None needed; both required details are in the selected sentences.

Verification:
- Bridge entity is paraphrased using the cap‑space announcement.
- Answer is a short name (Maya Torres).
- Both sentences are necessary: the first to identify the club, the second to provide the player and minute limit.

I listed all possible sentence IDs that contain the bridge entity Dana Loris: N0‑S4, N0‑S5 (from the first event) and N2‑S4, N2‑S6 (from the second event).  
To satisfy the rule that a tuple must span both events, I need one sentence from the first event and one from the second.  

I examined the content of each sentence:

- **N0‑S4** – talks about roster stability from Elara Finch’s contract.  
- **N0‑S5** – specifies the incentive clause activates only after Elara Finch logs **at least 500 minutes**.  
- **N2‑S4** – announces that Maya Torres’ playing minutes are limited to **12 minutes per quarter**.  
- **N2‑S6** – mentions the coach’s decision not to activate rookie Leila Kade.

The most interesting multi‑hop reasoning involves numeric playing‑time thresholds, allowing a question that compares the minimum minutes required for Elara Finch’s incentive with the maximum minutes allowed per quarter for Maya Torres. This requires linking the two sentences and the bridge entity (the coach who made both statements).  

Other combinations (e.g., N0‑S4 with N2‑S6) are less concrete for a multi‑hop question because they involve qualitative concepts (roster stability vs bench decisions) rather than a clear quantitative comparison.  

Thus I select **N0‑S5** and **N2‑S4** as the optimal pair.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N0-S5, N2-S4</ids>
<explanation>This pair links two distinct events through Coach Dana Loris. The first sentence (N0‑S5) provides a concrete condition – Elara Finch must log at least 500 minutes for her performance incentive to activate. The second sentence (N2‑S4) gives a separate playing‑time restriction – Maya Torres is limited to 12 minutes per quarter. A multi‑hop question can ask the learner to state the minimum minutes required for Finch’s incentive and compare it to the per‑quarter limit imposed on Torres, requiring reasoning across both sentences while the bridge entity (Dana Loris) is the common source of both policies.</explanation>

We need a pair of sentences that both mention the bridge entity **Dana Loris** and come from the two different events so that a multi‑hop question can link information across events.

Possible sentences with Dana Loris:
- **N0‑S4** (first event) – talks about roster stability from Elara Finch’s contract.
- **N0‑S5** (first event) – specifies the incentive clause activates after Elara Finch logs **500 minutes**.
- **N3‑S4** (second event) – says Dana Loris confirms Maya Torres is medically cleared and will play full minutes.
- **N3‑S5** (second event) – gives a concrete expectation that Maya Torres will log **at least 30 minutes** in the opening game.

For a compelling multi‑hop question we want concrete, comparable data that requires reasoning across the two events. The pair **N0‑S5** and **N3‑S5** provides:
1. A quantitative threshold (500 minutes) for Elara Finch’s incentive.
2. A quantitative expectation (30 minutes) for Maya Torres’s playing time in the season opener.

A question could ask: *“What is the minimum number of minutes Elara Finch must play to trigger her contract incentive, and how does that figure compare to the minutes Coach Dana Loris expects Maya Torres to log in the season opener?”*  
Answering requires retrieving the 500‑minute threshold from N0‑S5 and the 30‑minute expectation from N3‑S5, then performing a simple comparison. No other sentence or the knowledge base provides these exact figures, so the pair is essential.

Thus the best selection is N0‑S5 (first event) and N3‑S5 (second event).

Together they enable a multi‑hop question that compares the required playing time for Finch’s incentive with the expected playing time for Torres, requiring reasoning across both sentences and the bridge entity.</explanation>

I examined the two selected sentences:

- N0‑S5: The incentive clause activates only after Elara Finch logs a minimum of 500 minutes.
- N3‑S5: Coach said Maya Torres will log at least 30 minutes in the game.

To create unknown‑premise questions, I keep the core ask (minimum minutes for Elara Finch) but add one specific detail that is plausible yet not mentioned anywhere in the provided sentences or broader context. Possible added details include a particular game (season opener, home game, high‑tempo offense, exact 30‑minute log, jersey‑sales milestone). Each added detail cannot be verified or contradicted by any sentence, making the answer unknowable without further information.

I listed all sentence IDs that contain the bridge entity Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club.  
First event (contract extension) sentences: N0‑S0, N0‑S2, N0‑S4, N0‑S6, N0‑S8.  
Second event (season‑opening game) sentences: N4‑S0, N4‑S2, N4‑S4, N4‑S6, N4‑S8.  

To satisfy the requirement of covering both events, I need one ID from each set.  
I looked for a pair where each sentence provides a distinct, concrete fact that is not present elsewhere in the knowledge base, so a question would need to combine both pieces of information.

- N0‑S8 states: “Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club announces that the reduced salary allocation from Elara Finch’s extension frees cap space to sign a backup shooting guard… The freed cap space, estimated at $12,000, will be allocated to sign veteran guard Maya Torres…”
  → Gives a specific monetary amount ($12,000) of cap space freed.

- N4‑S2 states: “Maya Torres of Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club scored 22 points and recorded three assists in the season‑opening game.”
  → Gives Maya Torres’s point total in the opening game.

These two facts are complementary: one is about the financial effect of the contract extension, the other about the on‑court performance of the player who will benefit from that cap space. A multi‑hop question can ask for both numbers, requiring the model to retrieve the cap‑space amount from the contract‑extension sentence and the point total from the game‑summary sentence, using Rivergate Rivets as the bridge entity.

No other sentence pair offers such a clear, quantitative cross‑event link, and the needed details are not available in the provided knowledge base entries. Therefore this pair is the best candidate.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N0-S8, N4-S2</ids>
<explanation>This pair links the contract‑extension event (cap space freed: $12,000) with the season‑opening game event (Maya Torres scored 22 points). Both sentences mention Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club, satisfying the bridge‑entity requirement. A multi‑hop question can ask: “How much cap space did Rivergate Rivets free up by extending Elara Finch’s contract, and how many points did Maya Torres score in the season‑opening game?” Answering requires combining the monetary figure from N0‑S8 with the scoring figure from N4‑S2, and the information is not available elsewhere in the knowledge base.</explanation>

Sentence information: 
- N0-S8: The club (Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club) announced that the reduced salary allocation from Elara Finch's extension freed cap space to sign a backup shooting guard before the season opener.
- N4-S2: Maya Torres, a player of the same club, scored 22 points and recorded three assists in the season‑opening game.

Idea: Ask for the point total scored by the player who performed in the season‑opening game for the club that used the freed cap space to sign a backup shooting guard.

Additional sentences: None needed. Both required details are present in the selected sentences.

Verification:
- The bridge entity is paraphrased using the unique detail from N0‑S8 (freed cap space to sign a backup shooting guard).
- The question asks for a specific numeric answer (points) that is only given in N4‑S2.
- Both sentences are required to resolve the question; without N0‑S8 the club reference would be ambiguous, and without N4‑S2 the point total would be unknown.

I listed all sentences that contain the bridge entity Dana Loris (IDs N0‑S4, N0‑S5, N4‑S4, N4‑S5).  
To satisfy the rule that a tuple must span both events, I need one sentence from the first event (N0) and one from the second event (N4).  

- N0‑S5 gives a specific quantitative condition set by Coach Loris: the incentive clause for Elara Finch only activates after she logs **at least 500 minutes** on the court.  
- N4‑S4 provides a concrete fact about a different player in the opening game: Coach Loris confirms **Maya Torres played the full 40 minutes**.  

These two sentences together allow a multi‑hop question that requires the reader to retrieve the minutes threshold for Finch’s incentive and the actual minutes played by Torres, linking the two pieces of information through the common bridge entity (Coach Dana Loris). No other sentence or the known‑entity data contains these exact details, so the pair is uniquely suitable.  

Other possible pairs (e.g., N0‑S4 with N4‑S5) are less compelling because they combine qualitative statements rather than clear, comparable quantitative facts. Therefore the best combination is N0‑S5 and N4‑S4.

A multi‑hop question can ask about the minutes condition for Finch’s incentive and compare it to the actual minutes logged by Torres, requiring reasoning across both sentences while the bridge entity (Dana Loris) connects them.</explanation>

Sentence information:

- N4-S4: The same coach (Dana Loris) confirmed that Maya Torres played the full 40 minutes after her rehabilitation program.

Idea: 
Ask for the specific minute threshold for the incentive clause, using the coach’s identity described by the fact that she confirmed Maya Torres played the full 40 minutes. This forces the use of both sentences: one to know the threshold, the other to identify the coach.

Additional sentences: 
None needed. Both required details are contained in the selected sentences.

Verification: 
Question paraphrases the bridge entity as “the coach who confirmed Maya Torres played the full 40 minutes,” which uniquely points to Dana Loris per N4‑S4. The answer (500 minutes) comes from N0‑S5. Both sentences are necessary; no other sentence provides this combination.

The bridge entity is **Dana Loris**. The only sentences that mention Dana Loris are N0‑S4 and N0‑S5.

- **N0‑S4** tells us that Coach Dana Loris says the contract extension “provides roster stability while rewarding Elara Finch’s availability post‑injury.” This gives a qualitative benefit of the extension (roster stability) linked to the player’s availability.

- **N0‑S5** adds a concrete detail from the same coach: the incentive clause “will activate only after Elara Finch logs a minimum of 500 minutes on the court.” This supplies a quantitative condition that must be met for the incentive.

These two sentences together allow a multi‑hop question that requires the model to (1) identify the specific condition for the incentive (500 minutes) and (2) relate it to the broader purpose of the contract as described by the coach (roster stability). No other sentence mentions Dana Loris, and the known named‑entity list is empty, so the needed information is unique to these two sentences.

Thus the pair N0‑S4 and N0‑S5 is the best (and only) combination for generating a challenging multi‑hop question with the bridge entity Dana Loris.

I examined all sentence IDs that contain the bridge entity “Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club”.  
From the first event, sentences N1‑S5 and N1‑S6 give detailed, unique information about the club’s community‑clinic funding and a celebrity’s participation.  
From the second event, sentences N2‑S4 and N2‑S8 provide distinct details about the club’s response to Maya Torres’s injury (a specific playing‑time restriction) and an official injury‑protocol statement.  

To create a multi‑hop question that requires linking two facts through the club, the best combination is:

* **N1‑S5** – “The club estimates net proceeds of approximately $180,000, which will fund a two‑day clinic at the Rivergate Community Center …”
* **N2‑S4** – “Coach Dana Loris of Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club announced that Maya Torres will have playing minutes limited to twelve per quarter …”

These two sentences each contain the bridge entity, provide unique quantitative details not found elsewhere, and together enable a question such as:  
“How much money did the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club estimate for the community clinic, and what is the maximum number of minutes per quarter that Maya Torres is allowed to play after her injury?”  

Answering requires retrieving the $180,000 figure from the first sentence and the 12‑minute limit from the second, using the club as the connecting element.

Both sentences mention the bridge entity, contain unique quantitative details not present elsewhere, and together support a challenging multi‑hop question that requires reasoning across the two facts.</explanation>

Sentence information: 
- N1-S5: The club estimates net proceeds of approximately $180,000 to fund a two‑day clinic for up to 150 youth, featuring coaching staff from Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club.
- N2-S4: Coach Dana Loris of Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club announced Maya Torres will have playing minutes limited to twelve per quarter for the remainder of the season’s opening month.

Idea: Ask for the estimated net proceeds amount, describing the club by the fact that its coach limited Maya Torres to 12 minutes per quarter. This requires recognizing that both sentences refer to the same club.

Additional sentences: None needed because both required details are present in the selected sentences.

Verification:
- The bridge entity is paraphrased using the unique detail from N2-S4 (coach limiting minutes).
- The answer ($180,000) comes from N1-S5.
- Both sentences are necessary to identify the club and retrieve the amount.
- The answer is concise.

I listed all sentence IDs that mention the bridge entity Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club.  
From the April 5 event the relevant sentences are N1‑S1, N1‑S2, N1‑S4, N1‑S5, N1‑S6.  
From the October 25 event the relevant sentences are N3‑S2, N3‑S6, N3‑S8.  

To satisfy the requirement of covering both events, I need one sentence from each event.  
I looked for a pair where each sentence provides distinct, non‑overlapping facts that can be linked through the bridge entity, enabling a multi‑hop question.  

- N1‑S4 states that the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club announced that all net proceeds from the limited‑edition Rise Together jersey will fund a free community basketball clinic in June 2025.  
- N3‑S2 states that the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club released a roster update confirming Maya Torres will be in the starting lineup for the season opener on 2025‑11‑05.  

These two sentences together allow a question such as:  
“Which player from the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club, slated to start in the season opener, will benefit from the community basketball clinic funded by the net proceeds of the Rise Together jersey?”  

The information (clinic funding and roster update) is not present in any other sentence or in the known‑entity database, making the pair suitable for a challenging multi‑hop question.  
No other combination offers a clearer bridge between a concrete event (clinic funding) and a concrete individual (starting player) while meeting all constraints.  
Thus I select the pair N1‑S4 and N3‑S2.

I examined all sentence IDs that contain the bridge entity “Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club”.  
From the first event (April 5) the relevant sentences are N1‑S1, N1‑S2, N1‑S4, N1‑S5, N1‑S6.  
From the second event (Nov 5) the relevant sentences are N4‑S2, N4‑S4, N4‑S6, N4‑S8 (N4‑S0 does not mention the club).

To satisfy the requirement of covering both events, I need one sentence from each event.  
I looked for pairs where each sentence provides a distinct piece of information that is not repeated elsewhere and that together can form a multi‑hop question using the club as the bridge.

- **N1‑S4** states that the club announced all net proceeds from the limited‑edition jersey will fund a free community basketball clinic in Rivergate scheduled for June 2025.  
- **N4‑S8** reports the final score of the club’s season‑opening game: Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club 81, Midland Mavericks 74.

These two sentences together allow a question such as:  
“Which community event will be funded by the proceeds of the Rise Together jersey, and what was the result of the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club’s season‑opening game?”  
Answering this requires linking the clinic information (from N1‑S4) with the game outcome (from N4‑S8) via the bridge entity.

No other sentence provides both the specific clinic detail and the game score, and the knowledge base does not contain these facts, so the pair is uniquely suitable.

<explanation>This pair links a community‑impact statement (the club will fund a free basketball clinic with jersey proceeds) with a competitive result (the club’s 81‑74 victory in their opening game). Both sentences mention the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club, come from different events, and each contributes unique information not found elsewhere, enabling a multi‑hop question that requires reasoning across the two sentences.</explanation>

Sentence information: 
- N1-S4: The club announced that all net proceeds from the limited‑edition Rise Together jersey sales will fund a free community basketball clinic scheduled for June 2025.
- N4-S8: The club’s game ended with a final score of 81‑74, and ticket sales reached 2,800 of the arena’s 3,200 capacity.

Idea: Ask for the number of tickets sold for the game, describing the club by the fact that it allocated jersey proceeds to a free community clinic. This requires linking the club across both sentences.

Additional sentences: None needed because both required details are present in the selected sentences.

Verification:
- The bridge entity is paraphrased using the allocation detail (from N1‑S4) and the question asks for ticket sales (from N4‑S8).
- Answer is concise (“2,800”) and can only be derived by combining the two sentences.
- No other sentence provides the same combination of details, ensuring uniqueness.

I examined all sentences that contain the bridge entity Sundara Sportswear (IDs N1‑S0, N1‑S2, N1‑S3, N1‑S8, N1‑S9).

Key pieces of information:
- **N1‑S0** gives the exact release date of the limited‑edition jersey (2025‑04‑05) and the launch location.
- **N1‑S9** provides the scheduled shipment date for the supplemental 2,000 jerseys (May 3, 2025) and the manufacturing site.

These two sentences each contain unique temporal data that is not present elsewhere in the event set or the knowledge base. By linking them, a multi‑hop question can be formed that requires calculating the number of days between the release and the planned shipment, forcing the model to retrieve both dates and perform a date‑difference reasoning step.

Other possible pairs (e.g., combining the initial allocation 3,000 units from N1‑S0 with the supplemental run of 2,000 units from N1‑S8) also work, but the date‑difference question is more concrete and interesting for multi‑hop reasoning.

Thus I selected the pair N1‑S0 and N1‑S9.

- N1-S9: An additional 2,000 jerseys will be manufactured at Sundara Sportswear’s Greenfield eco‑factory and are scheduled to ship on May 3, 2025, to be stocked at the same retail locations and the online store.

Idea: 
Ask for the shipment date of the extra 2,000 jerseys, describing the bridge entity by the unique detail from N1‑S0 (the company that released the limited‑edition jersey at its Sunvale flagship store). This forces the answer to rely on N1‑S9 for the date.

Additional sentences:
None needed. Both required details are present in the selected sentences.

Verification:
- The bridge entity is paraphrased as “the company that released the limited‑edition Rise Together jersey at its Sunvale flagship store,” which uniquely points to Sundara Sportswear using N1‑S0.

I examined all sentences that mention Maya Torres.  
From the first event (2025‑10‑04) the most concrete detail about her post‑injury restrictions is in **N2‑S4**, where Coach Dana Loris announces a limit of twelve minutes per quarter.  
From the second event (2025‑10‑25) the coach provides an updated expectation in **N3‑S5**, stating that Maya Torres is expected to log at least 30 minutes in the opening game, citing her conditioning metrics.  

These two sentences together allow a multi‑hop question that requires the reader to (1) recall the original minute cap imposed after the injury and (2) compare it with the later expectation for playing time once she is cleared. No other sentence or the known‑entity knowledge base gives both pieces of information, so the pair forms a unique reasoning path about Maya Torres’s playing‑time progression.  
Other possible pairs (e.g., linking the wearable GPS/heart‑rate monitoring data) were considered, but the minute‑cap vs. expected minutes contrast is clearer and more engaging for a multi‑hop question.

I listed the four sentences that mention the bridge entity Dana Loris:

- N2‑S4: announces a limit of 12 minutes per quarter for Maya Torres after her injury.
- N2‑S6: decides not to activate rookie Leila Kade.
- N4‑S4: confirms Maya Torres played the full 40 minutes in the season‑opening game.
- N4‑S5: notes Maya’s average heart‑rate during the game.

The goal is to create a multi‑hop question that requires reasoning over two sentences from the two different events.  
The most coherent pair is **N2‑S4** (minute restriction) and **N4‑S4** (actual minutes played).  
These sentences together let a question ask about the change between the coach’s initial restriction and the eventual playing time, which cannot be answered from any single sentence or from the knowledge‑base entry for Dana Loris.  
Other pairs either do not provide a clear logical link (e.g., benching Leila Kade vs heart‑rate) or repeat the same fact without a contrasting element.

Thus the chosen pair is N2‑S4 and N4‑S4.

N2‑S4 states the coach’s initial decision to limit Maya Torres to 12 minutes per quarter (a maximum of 48 minutes per game), while N4‑S4 later confirms that Maya played the full 40‑minute game after rehabilitation. Together they enable a multi‑hop question such as: “What was the difference between the playing‑time limit Coach Dana Loris set for Maya Torres after her injury and the actual minutes she logged in the season‑opening game?” The answer requires linking the two sentences, and the specific details are not available elsewhere in the dataset or the known entities.</explanation>

Idea: 
Ask for the total minutes Maya Torres actually played, referencing the coach by the unique detail from N2‑S4 (the 12‑minute‑per‑quarter limit) so the question requires both sentences.

I examined the four candidate sentences that mention the bridge entity “Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club”.

- **N2‑S0** describes the injury event (date, location, and Maya Torres’s bruised ankle) and explicitly names the club.
- **N2‑S1** gives the game situation when the injury happened (quarter, time left, score) and also names the club.
- **N2‑S4** reports the coach’s decision to limit Maya Torres’s playing minutes to twelve per quarter for the rest of the opening month, again referencing the club.
- **N2‑S8** contains the club’s official statement about the injury protocol and recovery commitment.

To craft a multi‑hop question we need two sentences that together provide a reasoning chain that cannot be answered from any single sentence or from the known‑entity knowledge base.  

The combination **N2‑S0** (injury occurrence) + **N2‑S4** (subsequent playing‑time restriction) forms a clear cause‑effect link: the injury leads to a specific limitation on minutes. Neither sentence alone tells us both the fact of the injury *and* the exact restriction; the knowledge base only lists Maya Torres as a player and Coach Dana Loris as a person, but does not contain the minute‑cap detail. Therefore a question such as “After Maya Torres injured her ankle during a Rivergate Rivets game, what playing‑time limitation was imposed on her for the rest of the opening month?” would require reasoning across both sentences, using the bridge entity as the connecting point.

Thus the pair N2‑S0 and N2‑S4 is the most suitable for generating an interesting multi‑hop question.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N2-S0, N2-S4</ids>
<explanation>This pair links the injury event (N2‑S0) with the coach’s subsequent decision to limit Maya Torres’s minutes (N2‑S4). Both sentences mention Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club, and the specific minute‑cap information is unique to N2‑S4, not present elsewhere. Together they enable a multi‑hop question that requires connecting the injury to the imposed playing‑time restriction.</explanation>

Sentence information: 
- N2-S0: Provides date (2025-10-04), event (second league game), location (Rivergate Sports Complex), and identifies the club as "Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club".
- N2-S4: States that "Coach Dana Loris of Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club announced" a playing‑minutes limit (12 per quarter) for Maya Torres.

Idea: Ask for the name of the club (bridge entity) by describing it with the unique context from N2‑S0 (second league game at Rivergate Sports Complex on 2025‑10‑04) and requesting the entity that performed the action described in N2‑S4 (announced the minute limit). The answer is concise: the club’s name.

Additional sentences: None needed because both required details are present in the two selected sentences.

Verification:
- The question does not mention the club name directly; it paraphrases using unique info from N2‑S0.
- Answer requires knowing that the club that announced the limit (from N2‑S4) is the same club described in N2‑S0, thus needing both sentences.
- No other sentence provides the same combination of details, ensuring uniqueness.
- Answer is short and factual.

I examined the two sentences that mention the bridge entity **Leila Kade** (IDs N2‑S6 and N2‑S7).

- **N2‑S6** tells us that Coach Dana Loris chose not to activate rookie reserve Leila Kade, notes that she is a recent graduate of Rivergate Academy of Sports, and that she remains on the bench despite Maya Torres’s reduced minutes.
- **N2‑S7** provides personal and performance details about Leila Kade: her height (5‑foot‑9), position (point guard), and her average statistics from her final academy season (4.2 points and 2.1 assists). It also mentions that she stays on the active roster and will keep practicing while awaiting a debut.

These two sentences together give complementary pieces of information about the same person that are not found elsewhere in the knowledge base. A multi‑hop question could require linking the fact that she was not activated (from N2‑S6) with her statistical performance or physical attributes (from N2‑S7), e.g., “What is the height of the rookie reserve who was kept on the bench, and how many points per game did she average in her final academy season?”

Thus, the pair (N2‑S6, N2‑S7) forms a suitable tuple for generating a challenging multi‑hop question with Leila Kade as the bridge entity.

I examined all sentence IDs that mention the bridge entity “Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club”.  
The candidates are:

- **N3‑S2** (first event): Announces the roster update that confirms Maya Torres will be in the starting lineup for the season opener.  
- **N3‑S6** (first event): Talks about the club’s commitment to player health – less concrete for a factual multi‑hop query.  
- **N3‑S8** (first event): Gives the date, venue, and opponent of the season opener, and that Maya Torres is slated to start.  
- **N4‑S0** (second event): Describes the opening tip‑off location and broadcast – mostly contextual.  
- **N4‑S2** (second event): Reports Maya Torres’s game performance (22 points, 3 assists).  
- **N4‑S4** (second event): Confirms she played the full 40 minutes.  
- **N4‑S6** (second event): Mentions a limited‑edition signature – not directly useful for a factual hop.  
- **N4‑S8** (second event): Provides the final score of the game.

For a compelling multi‑hop question we need one sentence from each event that together give a question requiring reasoning over both.  
The pair **N3‑S2** (roster update confirming starting‑lineup status) and **N4‑S2** (actual points scored in the game) satisfies this:

- The roster update uniquely tells us that Maya Torres was slated to start; this fact is not repeated elsewhere.  
- The game‑day report uniquely provides her scoring total; again, not duplicated.  
- Neither the knowledge‑base entries nor any other sentence give both pieces of information together, so a question must bridge them via the bridge entity (the club).

Thus the selected pair can generate a question such as:  
“According to the roster update released before the season opener, was Maya Torres listed in the starting lineup, and how many points did she score in that opening game for the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club?”

This requires linking the roster information (first event) with the performance statistics (second event) through the bridge entity.

<explanation>This pair links a pre‑game roster announcement (N3‑S2) that confirms Maya Torres will start for Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club with her actual scoring performance in the opening game (N4‑S2).

The bridge entity is **Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club**.  
Possible sentences that mention this entity are:

- **N3‑S2** – Announces the club’s official roster update, confirming Maya Torres will be in the starting lineup.
- **N3‑S6** – Talks about the club’s commitment to player health; less useful for a concrete fact‑based question.
- **N3‑S8** – Gives the date and opponent of the season opener, stating that Maya Torres is slated to start for the club.

To create a multi‑hop question we need two sentences that together provide a piece of information that cannot be derived from any single sentence or from the known entities.  
Combining **N3‑S2** (roster confirmation) with **N3‑S8** (season‑opener date) lets us ask something like:  
*“On what date will the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club feature Maya Torres in the starting lineup for their season opener?”*  

Answering this requires:
1. Knowing from N3‑S2 that Maya Torres is in the starting lineup for the club.  
2. Knowing from N3‑S8 that the season opener is on 2025‑11‑05.

No other sentence or knowledge base entry provides both the player‑lineup detail and the exact game date, making this pair ideal for a challenging multi‑hop question.

Thus the selected pair is N3‑S2 and N3‑S8.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N3-S2, N3-S8</ids>
<explanation>This pair links the club’s roster update (confirming Maya Torres will start) with the season‑opener schedule (date and opponent). Together they enable a multi‑hop question that requires reasoning across both sentences to determine when the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club will have Maya Torres in the starting lineup for their first game.</explanation>

Sentence information: 
- N3-S2: The club released an official roster update confirming Maya Torres will be listed in the starting lineup for the season opener on 2025‑11‑05.
- N3-S8: The season opener on 2025‑11‑05 will be held at Rivergate Sports Complex, featuring the club versus Midland Mavericks, with Maya Torres slated to start.

Idea: Ask for the name of the club that issued the roster update, describing the club by the details given in the other sentence (venue and opponent). This forces the use of both sentences to identify the club.

Additional sentences: None needed because both required details are present in the selected sentences.

Verification:
- Question paraphrases the bridge entity using unique info from N3‑S8 (venue and opponent) and asks for information found in N3‑S2 (the roster update).
- Answer is concise: the club’s name.
- Both sentences are required; without N3‑S8 the club could not be uniquely identified, and without N3‑S2 the specific action (roster update) would be missing.

I examined the two sentences that mention the bridge entity Dana Loris:

- **N4‑S4**: States that Dana Loris confirmed Maya Torres played the full 40 minutes after her rehabilitation program.
- **N4‑S5**: States that Dana Loris noted Maya Torres’ average heart‑rate was 152 bpm during the game, matching pre‑injury benchmarks.

Both sentences provide distinct quantitative details (minutes played vs. average heart‑rate) that are not repeated elsewhere in the event description or in the known‑entity knowledge base. Combining them allows a multi‑hop question that requires the reader to retrieve two separate facts linked by the same source (Dana Loris). For example: “According to Coach Dana Loris, how many minutes did Maya Torres play and what was her average heart‑rate in the season‑opening game?” This question forces the reasoning step of connecting the two statements through the bridge entity.

Thus the pair N4‑S4 and N4‑S5 is the best (and only) candidate for generating a challenging multi‑hop question with the bridge entity Dana Loris.

Key facts:

I listed all sentences that contain the bridge entity Maya Torres (IDs N4‑S1 to N4‑S7).  
To form a multi‑hop question we need two sentences that each provide a distinct piece of information about Maya Torres, and the answer to a question must require combining those pieces.

Potential pairs considered:
- N4‑S4 (full 40‑minute play after rehab) + N4‑S5 (average heart‑rate 152 bpm) → could ask about her heart‑rate during the full game.
- N4‑S2 (scored 22 points) + N4‑S6 (limited‑edition signature announced) → could ask how many points she scored in the game that prompted the release of a signature item.
- N4‑S1 (recovery progress highlighted) + N4‑S4 (played full 40 minutes) → could ask what recovery aspect was highlighted and how long she played.

The pair N4‑S2 and N4‑S6 is the most compelling because it links a concrete performance statistic with a marketing action that directly references that performance, creating a clear two‑step reasoning chain. No other sentence provides both the scoring detail and the merchandise detail, and the known named‑entity data does not contain either of these specifics.

Thus I select the pair N4‑S2 and N4‑S6.
</scratchpad>

<selection>
<ids>N4-S2, N4-S6</ids>
<explanation>This pair combines Maya Torres' game performance (scoring 22 points and three assists) with the announcement of a limited‑edition Maya Torres signature item. A multi‑hop question can ask, for example, “How many points did Maya Torres score in the season‑opening game that led to the release of a limited‑edition signature merchandise?” Answering requires linking the scoring information from N4‑S2 with the merchandise announcement in N4‑S6, and the details are not available elsewhere in the knowledge base.</explanation>

I need to create several new questions based on the two selected sentences.  
Key info: Maya Torres scored 22 points (N4‑S2) and a limited‑edition Maya Torres signature will be sold at Rivergate Community Center (N4‑S6).  

I will keep the core ask about “how many points … scored in the season‑opening game” and add one extra specific detail that is plausible but not mentioned anywhere in the provided sentences or broader context.  
Possible added details: points in the first half, total rebounds, shoe size, age at the time of the game, hometown, number of steals, number of turnovers, number of fans who bought the signature, etc.  
All of these are not confirmed or refuted by any sentence, so the question becomes unanswerable (unknown premise).  

I will produce a separate <qa> block for each question, with a brief explanation of why the added detail is unknown.

Maya Torres Cleared to Return: Rivets Set to Feature Star Guard in Season Opener</headline>

<text>Dr. Lina Ortiz, the sports‑medicine physician for the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club, announced at the Rivergate Sports Complex on October 25, 2025, that veteran shooting guard Maya Torres has successfully completed a three‑week ankle rehabilitation program. The protocol combined aquatic therapy, proprioceptive drills, and weekly ultrasound assessments, all detailed in a medical report presented by Dr. Ortiz during the press briefing.</text>
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
<text>Following the medical clearance, Coach Dana Loris held a press conference at the same venue, confirming Torres is medically cleared and will start in the upcoming season opener on November 5, 2025. “Maya Torres’s conditioning metrics are back to pre‑injury levels, and we anticipate she will log at least 30 minutes in the game while the team executes our high‑tempo offense,” Loris said, citing the latest GPS and heart‑rate data. The Rivets have updated their roster to list Torres in the starting lineup, ticket sales have already reached 2,800 of the arena’s 3,200 capacity, and the matchup will be broadcast live on Valoria Sports Network with a pre‑game analysis segment focusing on her return.</text>

<text>Following the medical clearance, Coach Dana Loris held a press conference at the same venue, confirming Torres is medically cleared and will start in the upcoming season opener on November 5, 2025. “Maya Torres’s conditioning metrics are back to pre‑injury levels, and we anticipate she will log at least 30 minutes in the game while the team executes our high‑tempo offense,” Loris said, citing the latest GPS and heart‑rate data. The Rivets have updated their roster to list Torres in the starting lineup, ticket sales have already reached 2,800 of the arena’s 3,200 capacity, and the matchup will be broadcast live on Valoria Sports Network with a pre‑game analysis segment focusing on her return.</text>

- Review each factual statement against the ground‑truth data.
- All statements in the original draft are supported except for two minor wording issues:
  1. The phrase “sports‑medicine physician for the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club” implies an official title not explicitly given; rephrase to “sports‑medicine physician who works with the Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club.”
  2. The term “press briefing” is not used in the ground truth; replace it with “press conference,” which matches the described event.
- No other content requires removal, hedging, or addition.
- Apply these adjustments while preserving the article’s concise, factual tone and structure.
- Ensure all XML special characters are escaped (e.g., “&” → “&amp;”). No such characters appear in the text, but the XML is kept well‑formed.

- Review each factual claim in the three paragraphs against the ground‑truth event information.
- All statements are supported except the adjective “nationwide” describing the broadcast; the ground truth only confirms the game was broadcast live on Valoria Sports Network, not that it reached a nationwide audience.
- Remove the word “nationwide” to avoid an unverified claim while preserving the sentence flow.

- Review each ground‑truth sentence and verify inclusion.
- First paragraph: add phrase “the opening tip‑off” and explicitly name both teams and the final score as “Rivergate Rivets Women’s Basketball Club 81, Midland Mavericks 74”.
- Ensure broadcast time and network are clearly stated (already present).
- Second paragraph: keep all existing details; no changes needed.
- Third paragraph: keep attendance numbers; maybe rephrase “walk‑in ticket buyers” to “walk‑in tickets sold at the gate” to match ground truth.
- Add a brief fourth paragraph summarizing the attendance breakdown if needed, but third paragraph already covers it; just adjust wording slightly.
- Maintain original tone: concise, factual, sports‑news style.
