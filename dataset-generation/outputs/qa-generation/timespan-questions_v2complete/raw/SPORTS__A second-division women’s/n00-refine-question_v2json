Since the registration is known to have happened before 2025\u201103\u201120 and the event\u2019s latest date is 2025\u201103\u201115, we infer that the registration was recorded on 2025\u201103\u201115.\nAssumptions:\n- The registration was recorded on the event date (2025\u201103\u201115) because no later date is mentioned and the event date is the latest possible date for actions described in the event.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Registration date inferred as 2025\u201103\u201115.\n\n[Sentence N0-S7]:\n- States that the limited\u2011edition jersey will be released on April\u202f5 (no year given, but context is the same 2025 season).\nAssumptions:\n- The release year is 2025, matching the event\u2019s year.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Jersey release date = 2025\u201104\u201105.\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None needed; the two selected sentences together provide all required dates.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the number of days between the registration (derived from N0\u2011S2 and the event date) and the jersey release (from N0\u2011S7). Both sentences are essential: N0\u2011S2 gives the registration\u2019s latest possible day, N0\u2011S7 gives the release day.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- From 2025\u201103\u201115 to 2025\u201104\u201105:\n  * March has 31 days \u2192 31\u202f\u2212\u202f15\u202f=\u202f16 days remaining in March.\n  * Add 5 days of April \u2192 16\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f21 days.\n- Duration = 21 days.\n</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nProblems identified:\n1. **Missing explicit assumption** \u2013 The original question asks for the number of days between two specific days, but the registration day is not directly given in the selected sentence N0\u2011S2. It only states the registration occurred \u201cbefore the domestic transfer deadline of 2025\u201103\u201120.\u201d The answer (21 days) relies on the assumption that the registration happened on the event date (2025\u201103\u201115), which was not stated in the question.\n2. **Question does not reference the needed assumption** \u2013 Because the assumption is omitted, the question could be considered ambiguous and therefore not fully compliant with the instruction that any required assumptions must be made explicit in the question.\n3. **No violation of other criteria** \u2013 The selected sentences are still the only sources of the required dates, and no additional sentences are needed.\n\nCorrections made:\n- Revised the question to explicitly state the assumption that the registration was recorded on the event date (the latest date mentioned in the outline). This keeps the question free of absolute dates while making the necessary assumption clear.\n- Kept the answer unchanged (21 days) because, under the stated assumption, the calculation remains correct.\n- No additional sentence IDs are required, so the `<additional_sentence_ids>` field stays empty.\n\nThe corrected response now satisfies all task requirements.\n</scratchpad>",
