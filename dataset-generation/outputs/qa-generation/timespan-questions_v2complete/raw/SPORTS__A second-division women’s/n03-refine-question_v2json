This requires both the rehab\u2011completion date (N3\u2011S0) and the season\u2011opener date (N3\u2011S2); no other sentence provides either date.\n\nAnswer derivation:\n- Using the two absolute dates above, the interval is 11 days.\n</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\n**Issues identified:**\n- The original question asked for the duration between rehab completion (2025\u201110\u201125) and the season\u2011opener start (2025\u201111\u201105).  \n- The season\u2011opener date and the fact that Maya Torres will start are also mentioned in sentence **N3\u2011S8**. Therefore, sentence **N3\u2011S2** is *not* strictly required to answer the question, violating the instruction that *all* selected sentences must be necessary and that *no other* sentence can replace any of them.\n\n**Correction made:**\n- Revised the question to require the *date of the roster update* (the event date of the N3\u2011S2 entry), which is unique to that sentence.  \n- The new question asks for the number of days between Maya Torres completing her rehabilitation (N3\u2011S0) and the club *releasing* the official roster update (N3\u2011S2). Both dates are explicitly the same (the event date 2025\u201110\u201125), so the answer is **0 days**.\n- This formulation ensures that both selected sentences are essential and that no other sentence in the outline can replace either of them.\n\n**Derivation of dates:**\n- **N3\u2011S0**: \u201c...completed her ankle rehabilitation program on 2025\u201110\u201125.\u201d \u2192 rehab completion date = 2025\u201110\u201125.\n- **N3\u2011S2**: The roster update is part of the event dated 2025\u201110\u201125, so the release date = 2025\u201110\u201125.\n- Duration = 0 days (same calendar day).\n\n**Resulting QA pair meets all task criteria.**\n</scratchpad>",
