Both sentences are required: one gives the start time, the other gives the duration of her participation.\n\nAnswer derivation:\n- End time \u2013 start time = 19:40 \u2013 19:00 = 40\u202fminutes.\n</scratchpad>",

To obtain an exact date we must rely on another sentence in the outline.\n\n[Additional Sentence N1-S7]:\n- Gives the exact date of the clinic: \u201cJune\u202f12 clinic.\u201d\n- Therefore the clinic occurs on 2025-06-12. No time of day is specified; we assume the clinic starts at 00:00 on that date (the earliest possible moment on that day).\n\nAssumptions:\n- The June community clinic referenced in N4\u2011S7 is the same clinic mentioned in N1\u2011S7 (June\u202f12,\u202f2025). This is a reasonable link because both sentences refer to \u201cthe upcoming June community clinic\u201d and N1\u2011S7 is the only sentence that supplies a concrete day in June.\n- The clinic\u2019s start time is taken as midnight (00:00) on 2025\u201106\u201112 because no time is provided.\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Clinic start: 2025\u201106\u201112\u202f00:00.\n- Opening tip\u2011off: 2025\u201111\u201105\u202f19:00.\n\nDuration calculation:\n- Days from 2025\u201106\u201112 to 2025\u201111\u201105 = 146 days (18\u202fdays in June after the 12th, plus full months July\u2011Oct, plus 5\u202fdays in November).\n- Additional hours from 00:00 to 19:00 on the final day = 19\u202fhours.\n- Total elapsed time = 146\u202fdays\u202f19\u202fhours.\n\nQuestion Idea:\nCreate a question that requires:\n1. The exact date of the June clinic (from N1\u2011S7).\n2. The exact time of the opening tip\u2011off (from N4\u2011S0).\nBoth selected sentences are needed, and the additional sentence N1\u2011S7 is essential to resolve the clinic\u2019s day. No other sentences provide the June\u202f12 date, so the question cannot be answered without all three.\n\nAnswer derivation:\nUsing the dates above, the elapsed time is 146\u202fdays\u202f19\u202fhours.\n</scratchpad>",
