Both sentences are required: N1\u2011S9 gives the shipping date, N1\u2011S7 gives the clinic date. No other sentence supplies either exact date, so the question cannot be answered without both.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Days from May\u202f3 to May\u202f31 = 28 days (excluding May\u202f3).\n- Days from June\u202f1 to June\u202f12 = 12 days.\n- Total = 28 + 12 = 40 days.\n</scratchpad>",
      "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nProblems identified:\n1. The generated question does not explicitly state the assumption that the year for both dates is the same as the event year (2025). The task requires that any assumptions needed for answering the question be clearly stated in the question itself.\n2. No other issues were found: the question requires both selected sentences, avoids mentioning absolute dates, and the answer (40 days) is correctly derived.\n\nCorrections made:\n- Revised the question to explicitly include the assumption that both dates occur in the same calendar year as the event (2025). This satisfies the instruction to state assumptions in the question.\n- The answer and the list of additional sentence IDs remain unchanged because no extra sentences are needed.\n\nDerivation (unchanged):\n- Shipping date from N1\u2011S9: May\u202f3,\u202f2025.\n- Clinic date from N1\u2011S7: June\u202f12,\u202f2025.\n- Days between: 28 (May\u202f4\u2011May\u202f31) + 12 (June\u202f1\u2011June\u202f12) = 40 days.\n</scratchpad>",
