        "scratchpad": "<scratchpad>\n[Sentence ID]: N1-S0\n- Time information: Provides an absolute release date of the limited\u2011edition jersey: **2025\u201104\u201105**.\n- Event date: The event containing this sentence is dated 2025\u201104\u201105, which aligns with the release date (the event date is the latest date for that event).\n\n[Sentence ID]: N1\u2011S9\n- Time information: Provides an absolute scheduled shipping date for the supplemental 2,000 jerseys: **2025\u201105\u201103**.\n- Event date: The event containing this sentence is dated 2025\u201104\u201105, but the sentence itself specifies a future date (May\u202f3,\u202f2025).\n\nAssumptions:\n- Both dates are exact calendar dates; no time\u2011of\u2011day is needed for day\u2011level duration.\n- The duration is calculated as the number of full days from the release date (April\u202f5) up to but not including the shipping date (May\u202f3). This is the standard difference between two dates.\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Release date: 2025\u201104\u201105\n- Shipping date: 2025\u201105\u201103\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None required. The two selected sentences contain all necessary absolute dates.\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the number of days that elapse between the release of the limited\u2011edition jersey and the scheduled shipping of the supplemental run. This requires extracting both dates from the two selected sentences; no other sentence provides either date.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Days in April after the 5th: 30\u202f\u2212\u202f5\u202f=\u202f25 days.\n- Add the first 3 days of May: 25\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f28 days.\n- Therefore, the duration is **28 days**.\n</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nThe previous response correctly follows the task instructions:\n\n- It uses both selected sentences (N1\u2011S0 and N1\u2011S9) to extract the required absolute dates.\n- The question does not mention any explicit dates, only refers to the events described in the selected sentences, satisfying the requirement to avoid absolute dates in the question.\n- Both selected sentences are necessary to answer the question; no other sentence provides either the release date or the shipping date.\n- No additional sentences are needed.\n- The calculation of the duration (28 days) is correct based on the dates 2025\u201104\u201105 and 2025\u201105\u201103, and no extra assumptions are required.\n- The answer is given as a concise absolute duration.\n\nNo corrections are needed.\n</scratchpad>",

Both sentences are required: N1\u2011S9 gives the shipping date, N1\u2011S7 gives the clinic date. No other sentence supplies either exact date, so the question cannot be answered without both.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Days from May\u202f3 to May\u202f31 = 28 days (excluding May\u202f3).\n- Days from June\u202f1 to June\u202f12 = 12 days.\n- Total = 28 + 12 = 40 days.\n</scratchpad>",
