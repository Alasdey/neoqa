  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with creating fictional entities based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate detailed, coherent, and realistic descriptions for new locations, persons, organizations, products, art, buildings, events, and miscellaneous entities. \nFollow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. Review the existing entities (if provided):\n\n<existing_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</existing_entities>\n\n2. Review the names of new entities to be created:\n<new_entity_names>\n{{USED_NEW-LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-PERSONS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-ARTS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-EVENTS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</new_entity_names>\n\n3. Carefully read the provided outline:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\nBased on the information provided, create detailed descriptions for each new entity following these guidelines:\n\nGeneral instructions:\n- Ensure all created entities are entirely fictional and not similar to any real or known fictional entities.\n- Maintain realism and coherence with the provided outline and other entities.\n- Create a believable and consistent fictional world that aligns with the context of the outline.\n- For entity descriptions, focus on providing a solid background that remains valid throughout the story, rather than basing it centrally on the outline itself.\n- Develop well-rounded entities with backgrounds and characteristics that can support various potential story developments beyond the specific outline provided.\n- Strictly derive all entities from the outline. Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the outline.\n- Do not alter the name of the entities.\n- Some properties (e.g., place, city, country, spouse, architect, country, nationality) must be filled with named entities. Make sure to use FICTIONAL named entities ( fictional places, cities, countries, spouse names, architects, countries, nationalities, etc.). Check if you should use one of the existing fictional named entities (from <new_entity_names> and <existing_entities>) or create a fictional name instead. DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic. If global impact isn\u2019t necessary, adjust the details to be more modest and appropriate.\n\nSpecific instructions for each entity type:\n\n1.

The injury occurred in the second quarter with 3:12 remaining on the clock, as {Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club|ORGANIZATION-1} trailed the {Midland Mavericks|ORGANIZATION-5} 34\u201128. Medical staff at {Rivergate Sports Complex|BUILDING-1} evaluated {Maya Torres|PERSON-3}\u2019s ankle and diagnosed a grade\u2011I contusion, prescribing rest and limited court time for a minimum of two weeks. Team physician Dr. {Lina Ortiz|PERSON-4} performed a bedside ultrasound that confirmed no ligament tear and applied an ice compress and compression wrap before sending {Maya Torres|PERSON-3} to the on\u2011site physiotherapy suite. Coach {Dana Loris|PERSON-2} of {Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club|ORGANIZATION-1} announced that {Maya Torres|PERSON-3} will have playing minutes limited to twelve per quarter for the remainder of the season\u2019s opening month. The twelve\u2011minute cap per quarter translates to a maximum of 48 minutes per game, and the coaching staff will track {Maya Torres|PERSON-3}\u2019s workload using the club\u2019s wearable GPS and heart\u2011rate monitors. Coach {Dana Loris|PERSON-2} decided not to activate rookie reserve {Leila Kade|PERSON-5}, a recent graduate of {Rivergate Academy of Sports|ORGANIZATION-6}, keeping {Leila Kade|PERSON-5} on the bench despite the reduced minutes for {Maya Torres|PERSON-3}. {Leila Kade|PERSON-5}, a 5\u2011foot\u20119 point guard who averaged 4.2 points and 2.1 assists in her final academy season, remains on the active roster and will continue to practice with the first\u2011team unit while awaiting a potential debut. {Rivergate Rivets Women's Basketball Club|ORGANIZATION-1} issued an official statement confirming the injury protocol for {Maya Torres|PERSON-3}, emphasizing player health and the team\u2019s commitment to compete at full strength once {Maya Torres|PERSON-3} recovers. Communications Director {Sofia Marquez|PERSON-6} said, \u201cMaya\u2019s health is our top priority, and we will allocate a portion of the net proceeds from the {[Rise Together jersey][PRODUCT-1]} {[Rise Together jersey campaign][MISCELLANEOUS-3]} to support her rehabilitation program.\u201d</outline></event>",
