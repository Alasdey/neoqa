The question must not mention the actual dates, forcing the answerer to extract the dates from the two selected sentences.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Registration date: 2025\u201103\u201115\n- Jersey release date: 2025\u201104\u201105\n- Days between = 21 days (March\u202f15\u202f\u2192\u202fApril\u202f5).\n\n</scratchpad>",
        "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\n**Problems identified:**\n1. **Missing explicit assumption** \u2013 The question asks for the number of days between the registration and the jersey release, but the exact registration date is not given in the selected sentence. The answer (21 days) relies on the assumption that the registration occurred on the event date (2025\u201103\u201115). The task requires any necessary assumptions to be stated explicitly in the question.\n2. **Implicit absolute date** \u2013 While the question avoids mentioning specific dates, it does not clarify that the registration date should be taken as the event date of the first event. This clarification is needed to make the question uniquely answerable.\n3. **Additional_sentence_ids** \u2013 The original response left this empty. Although no extra sentences are needed beyond the two selected ones, the IDs of the selected sentences should be listed for completeness.\n\n**Corrections made:**\n- Revised the question to explicitly state the assumption that the registration was recorded on the same day as the first event (the event that contains N0\u2011S2). This references the event date without naming the absolute date, satisfying the instruction to avoid absolute dates in the question while making the assumption clear.\n- Added the IDs of the two required sentences (N0\u2011S2 and N1\u2011S0) in the `<additional_sentence_ids>` field.\n- Provided an explanation of why each sentence is uniquely needed.\n\n**Derivation (unchanged):**\n- Registration date = event date of first event (2025\u201103\u201115 by assumption).\n- Jersey release date = 2025\u201104\u201105 (explicit in N1\u2011S0).\n- Days between = 21 days.\n\nThe corrected response now fully complies with the task instructions. \n</scratchpad>",

This is a common reporting practice and the only absolute date we can reliably anchor the registration to.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Registration (assumed) = 2025\u201103\u201115\n- Transfer deadline (mentioned) = 2025\u201103\u201120 (used only to confirm that the registration indeed occurred before this deadline)\n\n[Sentence ID: N3-S0]\n- The sentence explicitly says Maya Torres completed her ankle rehabilitation program **on 2025\u201110\u201125**.\n- Event date for this event is also 2025\u201110\u201125, matching the explicit date.\nAssumptions:\n- None needed; the date is directly given.\nAbsolute dates:\n- Rehabilitation completion = 2025\u201110\u201125\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- No additional sentences are required. All needed absolute dates are derived from the two selected sentences (with the reasonable assumption for N0\u2011S2).\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the number of days between the registration of Elara Finch\u2019s extension (as recorded before the deadline) and the completion of Maya Torres\u2019s rehabilitation program.\n- The question must explicitly state the assumption that the registration occurred on the event\u2019s date (2025\u201103\u201115) so that the answer is uniquely determined.\n- This forces the use of both selected sentences; no other sentence in the outline provides the exact rehabilitation completion date or a comparable registration date.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start date = 2025\u201103\u201115\n- End date   = 2025\u201110\u201125\n- Days in March after the 15th: 31\u201115 = 16\n- April: 30\n- May: 31\n- June: 30\n- July: 31\n- August: 31\n- September: 30\n- October up to the 25th: 25\n- Total = 16\u202f+\u202f30\u202f+\u202f31\u202f+\u202f30\u202f+\u202f31\u202f+\u202f31\u202f+\u202f30\u202f+\u202f25 = **224 days**\n</scratchpad>",

The event date for that block is 2025\u201103\u201115, and per the task we may use the event date when no more precise date is given.

To obtain an exact date we must rely on another sentence in the outline.\n\n[Additional Sentence N1-S7]:\n- Gives the exact date of the clinic: \u201cJune\u202f12 clinic.\u201d\n- Therefore the clinic occurs on 2025-06-12. No time of day is specified; we assume the clinic starts at 00:00 on that date (the earliest possible moment on that day).\n\nAssumptions:\n- The June community clinic referenced in N4\u2011S7 is the same clinic mentioned in N1\u2011S7 (June\u202f12,\u202f2025). This is a reasonable link because both sentences refer to \u201cthe upcoming June community clinic\u201d and N1\u2011S7 is the only sentence that supplies a concrete day in June.\n- The clinic\u2019s start time is taken as midnight (00:00) on 2025\u201106\u201112 because no time is provided.\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Clinic start: 2025\u201106\u201112\u202f00:00.\n- Opening tip\u2011off: 2025\u201111\u201105\u202f19:00.\n\nDuration calculation:\n- Days from 2025\u201106\u201112 to 2025\u201111\u201105 = 146 days (18\u202fdays in June after the 12th, plus full months July\u2011Oct, plus 5\u202fdays in November).\n- Additional hours from 00:00 to 19:00 on the final day = 19\u202fhours.\n- Total elapsed time = 146\u202fdays\u202f19\u202fhours.\n\nQuestion Idea:\nCreate a question that requires:\n1. The exact date of the June clinic (from N1\u2011S7).\n2. The exact time of the opening tip\u2011off (from N4\u2011S0).\nBoth selected sentences are needed, and the additional sentence N1\u2011S7 is essential to resolve the clinic\u2019s day. No other sentences provide the June\u202f12 date, so the question cannot be answered without all three.\n\nAnswer derivation:\nUsing the dates above, the elapsed time is 146\u202fdays\u202f19\u202fhours.\n</scratchpad>",

The question should reference the events or sentence IDs instead of stating the dates directly.\n2. The question should still require all three sentences (the two selected ones and the additional N1\u2011S7) to compute the duration, but without mentioning the dates explicitly.\n\nCorrections made:\n- Re\u2011phrased the question to refer to the clinic described in sentence N1\u2011S7 (assumed to start at midnight) and the tip\u2011off described in sentence N4\u2011S0 (which occurred at 7:00\u202fPM). This removes absolute dates from the question while still requiring the same information.\n- Kept the answer unchanged (146 days, 19 hours) as the calculation remains correct.\n- Retained N1\u2011S7 as the only additional sentence needed.\n</scratchpad>",
