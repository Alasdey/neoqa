The tournament announcement date (N4-S0) and exhibition game announcement date (N0-S14) are sufficient, but the additional sentence N4-S2 is not necessary for calculating the time span.\n\n2. The answer should be more precise. The time span between March 15 and July 15 is exactly 4 months, but it's better to specify the exact number of days for accuracy.\n\n3. The additional sentence explanation is incorrect because N4-S2 doesn't provide any temporal information needed for the calculation.\n\n4. The question should be more specific about what is being measured (the time between announcements) to avoid ambiguity.\n\nCorrections:\n- Remove the unnecessary additional sentence N4-S2\n- Make the question more specific\n- Provide a more precise answer in days\n</scratchpad>",
