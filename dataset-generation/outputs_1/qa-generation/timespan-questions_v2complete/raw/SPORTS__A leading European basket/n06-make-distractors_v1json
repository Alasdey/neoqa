These distractors should be challenging and appear realistic, but must not be valid answers to the question.\n\nFollow these guidelines when creating effective distractors:\n1. Ensure each distractor is clearly incorrect when compared to the correct answer.\n2. Use information from the fictional event outline to make distractors sound plausible.\n3. If possible, incorporate specific values or details from the outline to increase believability.\n4. Align distractors with non-answer text from the outline to make them more challenging.\n5. Vary the type and structure of distractors to avoid patterns.\n6. Ensure distractors are distinct from each other and the correct answer.\n7. Make sure that the distractor is not by accident a valid answer based on different information from the outline.\n8. Make sure all distractor options are plausible.\n\nPresent your {{NUM_DISTRACTORS}} distractor options in the following format:\n\n<distractors>\n<distractor>\n<answer>[The incorrect answer]</answer>\n<explanation>[A brief explanation why it is incorrect]</explanation>\n<distractor-sentences>[Comma separated sentence IDs of the sentences that make the distractor sound plausible]</distractor-sentences>\n</distractor>\n\n[Repeat the above structure for each distractor]\n</distractors>\n\nAfter each distractor, provide a brief explanation of why it's incorrect but plausible, and list all sentence IDs (as a comma-separated list) from the outline that make the distractor sound plausible. Leave the list of sentence IDs empty if none other sentence from the outline increases the plausibility for this distractor. Both should be included within the respective distractor tags.\n\nRemember, your goal is to create challenging distractors that will test the reader's understanding of the fictional event outline while ensuring they are definitively incorrect. Use your knowledge and creativity to craft distractors that are both believable and clearly distinguishable from the correct answer.\n\nBefore presenting your final distractors, use a <scratchpad> to brainstorm and refine your ideas. Consider different aspects of the outline that could be misinterpreted or confused, and how you can use these to create compelling distractors.\n\nOnce you have finalized your distractors, present them in the format specified above, ensuring that each one is unique, challenging, and clearly incorrect when compared to the correct answer.",

between the start of the clinic and the deadline for delivering the high-definition recordings of the affected games to the scouting missions?\n</question>\n\nThe correct answer to this question is:\n\n<correct_answer>\n52 days\n</correct_answer>\n\nTo correctly answer this question, these sentences from the outline are required:\n\n<selected-sentences>\n<item><id>N0-S19</id><text>The two

promised to deliver high-definition recordings of all affected games to the scouting missions within 48 hours, including detailed statistical analysis and player performance metrics.</text></item>\n</selected-sentences>\n\nYour task is to create 5 plausible but incorrect multiple-choice distractor options for this question. These distractors should be challenging and appear realistic, but must not be valid answers to the question.\n\nFollow these guidelines when creating effective distractors:\n1. Ensure each distractor is clearly incorrect when compared to the correct answer.\n2. Use information from the fictional event outline to make distractors sound plausible.\n3. If possible, incorporate specific values or details from the outline to increase believability.\n4. Align distractors with non-answer text from the outline to make them more challenging.\n5. Vary the type and structure of distractors to avoid patterns.\n6. Ensure distractors are distinct from each other and the correct answer.\n7. Make sure that the distractor is not by accident a valid answer based on different information from the outline.\n8. Make sure all distractor options are plausible.\n\nPresent your 5 distractor options in the following format:\n\n<distractors>\n<distractor>\n<answer>[The incorrect answer]</answer>\n<explanation>[A brief explanation why it is incorrect]</explanation>\n<distractor-sentences>[Comma separated sentence IDs of the sentences that make the distractor sound plausible]</distractor-sentences>\n</distractor>\n\n[Repeat the above structure for each distractor]\n</distractors>\n\nAfter each distractor, provide a brief explanation of why it's incorrect but plausible, and list all sentence IDs (as a comma-separated list) from the outline that make the distractor sound plausible. Leave the list of sentence IDs empty if none other sentence from the outline increases the plausibility for this distractor. Both should be included within the respective distractor tags.\n\nRemember, your goal is to create challenging distractors that will test the reader's understanding of the fictional event outline while ensuring they are definitively incorrect. Use your knowledge and creativity to craft distractors that are both believable and clearly distinguishable from the correct answer.\n\nBefore presenting your final distractors, use a <scratchpad> to brainstorm and refine your ideas. Consider different aspects of the outline that could be misinterpreted or confused, and how you can use these to create compelling distractors.\n\nOnce you have finalized your distractors, present them in the format specified above, ensuring that each one is unique, challenging, and clearly incorrect when compared to the correct answer.",

      "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nAfter reviewing the response, I found several issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The question assumes a specific date (June 1, 2024) for the joint coaching clinic, but the selected sentence only mentions \"June 2024\" without specifying a date. This assumption should be made explicit in the question.\n\n2. The answer derivation assumes the streaming outages occurred on the event date (July 21, 2024), but this should be stated as an assumption in the question.\n\n3. The additional sentence explanation should clarify that N6-S0 provides the context for when the 48-hour delivery period begins, which is essential for calculating the end date.\n\n4. The question should be rephrased to make the assumptions explicit and ensure it can only be answered using the selected sentences and the additional sentence.\n\n5. The answer should be recalculated based on the explicit assumptions stated in the question.\n</scratchpad>",
