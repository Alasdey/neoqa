The additional sentence explanation could be more detailed about why N1-S0 is necessary and what unique information it provides.\n\n3. The answer could be more precise by specifying the exact days (e.g., \"3 days from April 15 to April 18\").\n\n4. The assumptions made about the week in question could be made more explicit in the question.\n\nNo major corrections are needed, but these refinements would make the response more precise and complete.\n</scratchpad>",
