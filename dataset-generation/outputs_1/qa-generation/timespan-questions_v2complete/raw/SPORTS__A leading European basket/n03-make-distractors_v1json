Make sure all distractor options are plausible.\n\nPresent your 5 distractor options in the following format:\n\n<distractors>\n<distractor>\n<answer>[The incorrect answer]</answer>\n<explanation>[A brief explanation why it is incorrect]</explanation>\n<distractor-sentences>[Comma separated sentence IDs of the sentences that make the distractor sound plausible]</distractor-sentences>\n</distractor>\n\n[Repeat the above structure for each distractor]\n</distractors>\n\nAfter each distractor, provide a brief explanation of why it's incorrect but plausible, and list all sentence IDs (as a comma-separated list) from the outline that make the distractor sound plausible. Leave the list of sentence IDs empty if none other sentence from the outline increases the plausibility for this distractor. Both should be included within the respective distractor tags.\n\nRemember, your goal is to create challenging distractors that will test the reader's understanding of the fictional event outline while ensuring they are definitively incorrect. Use your knowledge and creativity to craft distractors that are both believable and clearly distinguishable from the correct answer.\n\nBefore presenting your final distractors, use a <scratchpad> to brainstorm and refine your ideas. Consider different aspects of the outline that could be misinterpreted or confused, and how you can use these to create compelling distractors.\n\nOnce you have finalized your distractors, present them in the format specified above, ensuring that each one is unique, challenging, and clearly incorrect when compared to the correct answer.",
