  "instructions": "You are an AI tasked with creating alternative fictional future news summaries based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate summaries of plausible alternative continuations of an existing narrative. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. First, you will be given known entities in this fictional world:\n\n<known_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</known_entities>\n\n2. Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>{{CONTINUATION_TEXT}}</text>\n<date>{{CONTINUATION_DATE}}</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create {{NUM_ALTERNATIVES}} contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre {{GENRE}}. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

The new facility, designed with an open-concept layout, features large glass windows that allow natural light to flood the indoor track and weight rooms. This institute was specifically designed to cater to the training needs of regional athletes, focusing on sports such as track and field, gymnastics, and swimming. The new facility, equipped with advanced biometric monitoring technology, was inaugurated with a formal ceremony attended by the known athletes of the institute, including prominent runners like {Alex Varner|PERSON-1} and gymnast {Alicia Wilton|PERSON-2}, who both expressed excitement about the new opportunities for training. The {Zenith Athletics Institute|ORGANIZATION-1}, in collaboration with tech firm {BioTrack Innovations|ORGANIZATION-2}, developed the unique biometric system to provide athletes with personalized performance analytics, integrating sensors that track heart rate, muscle activity, and movement patterns. During the event, Institute Director {Kevin Stratton|PERSON-3} highlighted, \"This facility represents a leap forward in training technology for athletes, especially those specializing in high-risk sports,\" emphasizing the potential for injury prevention and performance enhancement. The systems installed use sensors to gather real-time data, which is then analyzed to help athletes optimize their performance and reduce injury risks, with data being accessible through a secure mobile app. First to test the new biometric system were a group of young sprinters, who were fascinated by the real-time feedback they received during drills, noting improvements in their stride and posture. Sprinter {Chloe Mercer|PERSON-4} noted, \"The instant feedback on my running form has been invaluable. It\u2019s like having a coach at every moment,\" and mentioned how the system helped her identify areas for improvement that were previously unnoticed. Some concerns were voiced regarding the privacy of personal health data collected by the systems, prompting Director {Kevin Stratton|PERSON-3} to assure attendees of strict adherence to data protection regulations, including encryption and limited access to sensitive information. The facility contains a medium-sized field adjacent to an indoor track and several weight rooms, designed to support various sports such as track and field, gymnastics, and swimming, with each area equipped with specialized equipment for different training needs.

The new facility, designed with an open-concept layout, features large glass windows that allow natural light to flood the indoor track and weight rooms. This institute was specifically designed to cater to the training needs of regional athletes, focusing on sports such as track and field, gymnastics, and swimming. The new facility, equipped with advanced biometric monitoring technology, was inaugurated with a formal ceremony attended by the known athletes of the institute, including prominent runners like {Alex Varner|PERSON-1} and gymnast {Alicia Wilton|PERSON-2}, who both expressed excitement about the new opportunities for training. The {Zenith Athletics Institute|ORGANIZATION-1}, in collaboration with tech firm {BioTrack Innovations|ORGANIZATION-2}, developed the unique biometric system to provide athletes with personalized performance analytics, integrating sensors that track heart rate, muscle activity, and movement patterns. During the event, Institute Director {Kevin Stratton|PERSON-3} highlighted, \"This facility represents a leap forward in training technology for athletes, especially those specializing in high-risk sports,\" emphasizing the potential for injury prevention and performance enhancement. The systems installed use sensors to gather real-time data, which is then analyzed to help athletes optimize their performance and reduce injury risks, with data being accessible through a secure mobile app. First to test the new biometric system were a group of young sprinters, who were fascinated by the real-time feedback they received during drills, noting improvements in their stride and posture. Sprinter {Chloe Mercer|PERSON-4} noted, \"The instant feedback on my running form has been invaluable. It\u2019s like having a coach at every moment,\" and mentioned how the system helped her identify areas for improvement that were previously unnoticed. Some concerns were voiced regarding the privacy of personal health data collected by the systems, prompting Director {Kevin Stratton|PERSON-3} to assure attendees of strict adherence to data protection regulations, including encryption and limited access to sensitive information. The facility contains a medium-sized field adjacent to an indoor track and several weight rooms, designed to support various sports such as track and field, gymnastics, and swimming, with each area equipped with specialized equipment for different training needs.
