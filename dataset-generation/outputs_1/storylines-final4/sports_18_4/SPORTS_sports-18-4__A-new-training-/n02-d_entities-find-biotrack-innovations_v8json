  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying new named entities from a given outline of a fictional event description. Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<OUTLINE>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures. Note that these lists may be empty or contain partial information:\n\n<entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</entities>\n\nThe definitions with examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural landmarks, and regions.\nExamples: Paris, Mount Everest, California, Amazon Rainforest, Japan, Australia, Australian\n\n- Product\nDefinition: Goods or services created for consumer use or commercial purposes.\nExamples: iPhone, Coca-Cola, Microsoft Office, Tesla Model 3\n\n- Art\nDefinition: Creative works in various forms, including artifacts, ornaments, visual arts, literature, music, and performance.\nExamples: Mona Lisa, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Hamilton (musical)\n\n - Building\nDefinition: Structures designed for human occupancy or use, including residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity.

Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

      "<event><date>2023-09-15</date><outline>On September 15, 2023, the {Zenith Athletics Institute|ORGANIZATION-1} unveiled its new state-of-the-art training center in {Richmond Meadows|LOCATION-1}, a scenic area known for its lush greenery and proximity to local sports clubs. The new facility, designed with an open-concept layout, features large glass windows that allow natural light to flood the indoor track and weight rooms. This institute was specifically designed to cater to the training needs of regional athletes, focusing on sports such as track and field, gymnastics, and swimming. The new facility, equipped with advanced biometric monitoring technology, was inaugurated with a formal ceremony attended by the known athletes of the institute, including prominent runners like {Alex Varner|PERSON-1} and gymnast {Alicia Wilton|PERSON-2}, who both expressed excitement about the new opportunities for training. The {Zenith Athletics Institute|ORGANIZATION-1}, in collaboration with tech firm {BioTrack Innovations|ORGANIZATION-2}, developed the unique biometric system to provide athletes with personalized performance analytics, integrating sensors that track heart rate, muscle activity, and movement patterns. During the event, Institute Director {Kevin Stratton|PERSON-3} highlighted, \"This facility represents a leap forward in training technology for athletes, especially those specializing in high-risk sports,\" emphasizing the potential for injury prevention and performance enhancement. The systems installed use sensors to gather real-time data, which is then analyzed to help athletes optimize their performance and reduce injury risks, with data being accessible through a secure mobile app. First to test the new biometric system were a group of young sprinters, who were fascinated by the real-time feedback they received during drills, noting improvements in their stride and posture. Sprinter {Chloe Mercer|PERSON-4} noted, \"The instant feedback on my running form has been invaluable. It\u2019s like having a coach at every moment,\" and mentioned how the system helped her identify areas for improvement that were previously unnoticed. Some concerns were voiced regarding the privacy of personal health data collected by the systems, prompting Director {Kevin Stratton|PERSON-3} to assure attendees of strict adherence to data protection regulations, including encryption and limited access to sensitive information. The facility contains a medium-sized field adjacent to an indoor track and several weight rooms, designed to support various sports such as track and field, gymnastics, and swimming, with each area equipped with specialized equipment for different training needs. Ongoing educational workshops about the benefits and usage of biometric technology are planned to be held at the {Zenith Athletics Institute|ORGANIZATION-1}, with sessions led by experts from {BioTrack Innovations|ORGANIZATION-2} and experienced coaches.</outline></event>",
