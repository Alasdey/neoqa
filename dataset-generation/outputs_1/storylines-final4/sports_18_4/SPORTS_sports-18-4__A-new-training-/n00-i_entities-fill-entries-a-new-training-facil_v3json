Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the outline.\n- Do not alter the name of the entities.\n- Some properties (e.g., place, city, country, spouse, architect, country, nationality) must be filled with named entities.

Check if you should use one of the existing fictional named entities (from <new_entity_names> and <existing_entities>) or create a fictional name instead. DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic.

It\u2019s like having a coach at every moment,\" and mentioned how the system helped her identify areas for improvement that were previously unnoticed.\nSome concerns were voiced regarding the privacy of personal health data collected by the systems, prompting Director {Kevin Stratton|PERSON-3} to assure attendees of strict adherence to data protection regulations, including encryption and limited access to sensitive information.\nThe facility contains a medium-sized field adjacent to an indoor track and several weight rooms, designed to support various sports such as track and field, gymnastics, and swimming, with each area equipped with specialized equipment for different training needs.\nOngoing educational workshops about the benefits and usage of biometric technology are planned to be held at the {Zenith Athletics Institute|ORGANIZATION-1}, with sessions led by experts from {BioTrack Innovations|ORGANIZATION-2} and experienced coaches.\n</outline>\n\nBased on the information provided, create detailed descriptions for each new entity following these guidelines:\n\nGeneral instructions:\n- Ensure all created entities are entirely fictional and not similar to any real or known fictional entities.\n- Maintain realism and coherence with the provided outline and other entities.\n- Create a believable and consistent fictional world that aligns with the context of the outline.\n- For entity descriptions, focus on providing a solid background that remains valid throughout the story, rather than basing it centrally on the outline itself.\n- Develop well-rounded entities with backgrounds and characteristics that can support various potential story developments beyond the specific outline provided.\n- Strictly derive all entities from the outline.
