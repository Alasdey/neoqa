  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with creating fictional entities based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate detailed, coherent, and realistic descriptions for new locations, persons, organizations, products, art, buildings, events, and miscellaneous entities. \nFollow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. Review the existing entities (if provided):\n\n<existing_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</existing_entities>\n\n2. Review the names of new entities to be created:\n<new_entity_names>\n{{USED_NEW-LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-PERSONS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-ARTS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-EVENTS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{USED_NEW-MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</new_entity_names>\n\n3. Carefully read the provided outline:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\nBased on the information provided, create detailed descriptions for each new entity following these guidelines:\n\nGeneral instructions:\n- Ensure all created entities are entirely fictional and not similar to any real or known fictional entities.\n- Maintain realism and coherence with the provided outline and other entities.\n- Create a believable and consistent fictional world that aligns with the context of the outline.\n- For entity descriptions, focus on providing a solid background that remains valid throughout the story, rather than basing it centrally on the outline itself.\n- Develop well-rounded entities with backgrounds and characteristics that can support various potential story developments beyond the specific outline provided.\n- Strictly derive all entities from the outline. Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the outline.\n- Do not alter the name of the entities.\n- Some properties (e.g., place, city, country, spouse, architect, country, nationality) must be filled with named entities. Make sure to use FICTIONAL named entities ( fictional places, cities, countries, spouse names, architects, countries, nationalities, etc.). Check if you should use one of the existing fictional named entities (from <new_entity_names> and <existing_entities>) or create a fictional name instead. DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic. If global impact isn\u2019t necessary, adjust the details to be more modest and appropriate.\n\nSpecific instructions for each entity type:\n\n1. For each new location:\n   - Use the provided name and ID\n   - Determine an appropriate type (city, village, country, region, etc.)\n   - Write a concise single-sentence description that:\n     * Does not refer to any other entities\n     * Provides only background information, not related to the event in the outline\n     * Is general and serves as background for this event\n   - Include at least five additional properties from: population, area, founded, climate, elevation, country\n   - Format the output as follows:\n     <location>\n     <id>[Provided ID]</id>\n     <name>[Fictional name]</name>\n     <type>[city/village/country/region]</type>\n     <description>[One-sentence concise description]</description>\n     [Include at least 5 of: population, area, founded, climate, elevation, country]\n     </location>\n\n2.

Sprint|PRODUCT-2},\" designed specifically for athletes with limited upper body mobility, at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1} in {Tranquil Springs|LOCATION-2}.\n{Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, renowned for its crystal-clear waters and gentle currents, has been a popular training ground for adaptive water sports athletes for over a decade.\n{Darlene Marstone|PERSON-1}, head of the {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, highlighted the collaborative efforts between biomechanical engineers and athletes to develop bespoke adaptive technology integrated into the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}.\nThe {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, established in 2025, has been pivotal in advancing adaptive sports technologies and fostering partnerships with leading engineering firms.\nIn the preliminary rounds, solo athletes competed in 50-meter sprints, showcasing their precise balance and coordination while maneuvering the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1} equipment.\nThe {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, equipped with gyroscopic stabilizers, allow athletes to maintain balance and control, even in challenging water conditions.\nPrevailing conditions at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, well-known for its calm waters, provided an ideal environment for stability and control, which were critical for the athletes during the competitions.\nThe lake's consistent water temperature and minimal wave activity have made it a preferred location for adaptive sports events since its designation as a training site in 2028.\n{Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, the reigning champions in adaptive water sports, aimed to leverage their experience to excel in this new category by working with new recruits, many introduced to the sport only months prior.\n{Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, having won the {Adaptive Water Sports Championship|EVENT-2} three times consecutively, brought a wealth of experience and strategic insights to the {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2}.\nLed by coach {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2}, {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3}, a recently assembled team formed from international elite long-standing wheelchair swimmers, showcased innovative techniques that combined agility with enhanced hydrodynamic designs.\nCoach {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2}, a former Paralympic swimmer with over 15 years of coaching experience, has been instrumental in developing {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3}'s unique training regimen.\nThe {holographic scoreboard|PRODUCT-3} displaying live metrics and athlete performance analytics was appreciated by spectators for enhancing their understanding and enjoyment of the nuanced sport.\nThe scoreboard, developed by {TechVision Innovations|ORGANIZATION-4}, provided real-time data on speed, trajectory, and balance, offering spectators a deeper insight into the athletes' performances.\nDuring the closing ceremony, {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, a finalist in the sprint event, received applause for his advocacy work in promoting accessibility in sports technology and was awarded the {Paralympic Sports Innovation Award|EVENT-1}.\n{Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, who has been a vocal advocate for adaptive sports since his debut in the {Paralympic Games|EVENT-1} in 2028, has worked with several organizations to improve accessibility in sports facilities.\nOrganizer Vlad Petrovic, from the {International

expressions.\nThe {International Sports Development Federation|ORGANIZATION-5}, founded in 2020, has been at the forefront of promoting inclusivity and diversity in global sports events.\nFollowing the successful event, plans for a comprehensive development program for {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} were discussed, aiming to introduce the sport in schools and community centers worldwide.\nThe

entirely fictional and not similar to any real or known fictional entities.\n- Maintain realism and coherence with the provided outline and other entities.\n- Create a believable and consistent fictional world that aligns with the context of the outline.\n- For entity descriptions, focus on providing a solid background that remains valid throughout the story, rather than basing it centrally on the outline itself.\n- Develop well-rounded entities with backgrounds and characteristics that can support various potential story developments beyond the specific outline provided.\n- Strictly derive all entities from the outline. Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the outline.\n- Do not alter the name of the entities.\n- Some properties (e.g., place, city, country, spouse, architect, country, nationality) must be filled with named entities. Make sure to use FICTIONAL named entities ( fictional places, cities, countries, spouse names, architects, countries, nationalities, etc.). Check if you should use one of the existing fictional named entities (from <new_entity_names> and <existing_entities>) or create a fictional name instead. DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic. If global impact isn\u2019t necessary, adjust the details to be more modest and appropriate.\n\nSpecific instructions for each entity type:\n\n1.
