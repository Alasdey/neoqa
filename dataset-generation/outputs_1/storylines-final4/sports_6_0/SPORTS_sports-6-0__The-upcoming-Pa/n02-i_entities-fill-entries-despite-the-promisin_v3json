  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with creating fictional entities based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate detailed, coherent, and realistic descriptions for new locations, persons, organizations, products, art, buildings, events, and miscellaneous entities. \nFollow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. Review the existing entities (if provided):\n\n<existing_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</existing_entities>\n\n2.

Carefully read the provided outline:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\nBased on the information provided, create detailed descriptions for each new entity following these guidelines:\n\nGeneral instructions:\n- Ensure all created entities are entirely fictional and not similar to any real or known fictional entities.\n- Maintain realism and coherence with the provided outline and other entities.\n- Create a believable and consistent fictional world that aligns with the context of the outline.\n- For entity descriptions, focus on providing a solid background that remains valid throughout the story, rather than basing it centrally on the outline itself.\n- Develop well-rounded entities with backgrounds and characteristics that can support various potential story developments beyond the specific outline provided.\n- Strictly derive all entities from the outline. Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the outline.\n- Do not alter the name of the entities.\n- Some properties (e.g., place, city, country, spouse, architect, country, nationality) must be filled with named entities. Make sure to use FICTIONAL named entities ( fictional places, cities, countries, spouse names, architects, countries, nationalities, etc.). Check if you should use one of the existing fictional named entities (from <new_entity_names> and <existing_entities>) or create a fictional name instead. DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic. If global impact isn\u2019t necessary, adjust the details to be more modest and appropriate.\n\nSpecific instructions for each entity type:\n\n1.

The proposed curriculum includes a comprehensive module on the fundamentals of {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2}, featuring guidelines on the use of {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. The module will cover safety protocols, basic techniques, and the benefits of using {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, which are designed to enhance mobility and stability for athletes with physical challenges. An {informational session|EVENT-3} was conducted at {Cresthaven Community Center|LOCATION-4}, where students and teachers demonstrated the capabilities and safety features of the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1} developed by {TechVision Innovations|ORGANIZATION-4}. During the session, participants explored the gyroscopic stabilizers of the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, which allow athletes to maintain balance and control in water. {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, an influential advocate for adaptive sports, spoke at the session, highlighting the transformative potential of adaptive sports in schools and his hopes for increasing student engagement. Harris shared his vision of creating a more inclusive sports culture, where students of all abilities can participate and excel in adaptive sports. {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2} delivered a workshop for physical education teachers, instructing them on effectively coaching {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} techniques with diverse groups of students. Thorne's workshop included hands-on training sessions, where teachers practiced coaching techniques and learned how to adapt lessons for students with varying abilities. The first {pilot program|EVENT-4} of the curriculum began at {Cresthaven Primary School|LOCATION-3}, where equipment and trainers from {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3} provided on-site support and facilitated interactive lessons. At {Cresthaven Primary School|LOCATION-3}, students engaged in interactive lessons that focused on teamwork, coordination, and the joy of participating in a new sport. Local government representatives praised the initiative, asserting that the official endorsement by educational authorities signaled a significant step towards normalizing adaptive sports within mainstream education. Representatives emphasized that this initiative could serve as a model for other regions looking to integrate adaptive sports into their educational systems. Community feedback from early adopters of the program was overwhelmingly positive, with students expressing excitement about participating in a new sport and appreciating its inclusive nature. Students reported feeling more confident and motivated to participate in physical activities, highlighting the positive impact of the program on their overall well-being. Future community outreach events are planned by the {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1} to further encourage family and peer involvement in {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} activities. These events aim to foster a supportive community environment, where families can learn about adaptive sports and engage in activities together.</outline></event>"

    "HISTORY_XML": "<event><date>2030-09-16</date><outline>On 16 September 2030, the {Paralympic Games|EVENT-1} opened with the inaugural presentation of a new sport named \"{HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2},\" designed specifically for athletes with limited upper body mobility, at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1} in {Tranquil Springs|LOCATION-2}. {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, renowned for its crystal-clear waters and gentle currents, has been a popular training ground for adaptive water sports athletes for over a decade. {Darlene Marstone|PERSON-1}, head of the {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, highlighted the collaborative efforts between biomechanical engineers and athletes to develop bespoke adaptive technology integrated into the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. The {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, established in 2025, has been pivotal in advancing adaptive sports technologies and fostering partnerships with leading engineering firms. In the preliminary rounds, solo athletes competed in 50-meter sprints, showcasing their precise balance and coordination while maneuvering the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1} equipment. The {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, equipped with gyroscopic stabilizers, allow athletes to maintain balance and control, even in challenging water conditions. Prevailing conditions at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, well-known for its calm waters, provided an ideal environment for stability and control, which were critical for the athletes during the competitions. The lake's consistent water temperature and minimal wave activity have made it a preferred location for adaptive sports events since its designation as a training site in 2028. {Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, the reigning champions in adaptive water sports, aimed to leverage their experience to excel in this new category by working with new recruits, many introduced to the sport only months prior. {Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, having won the {Adaptive Water Sports Championship|EVENT-2} three times consecutively, brought a wealth of experience and strategic insights to the {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2}. Led by coach {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2}, {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3}, a recently assembled team formed from international elite long-standing wheelchair swimmers, showcased innovative techniques that combined agility with enhanced hydrodynamic designs. Coach {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2}, a former Paralympic swimmer with over 15 years of coaching experience, has been instrumental in developing {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3}'s unique training regimen. The {holographic scoreboard|PRODUCT-3} displaying live metrics and athlete performance analytics was appreciated by spectators for enhancing their understanding and enjoyment of the nuanced sport. The scoreboard, developed by {TechVision Innovations|ORGANIZATION-4}, provided real-time data on speed, trajectory, and balance, offering spectators a deeper insight into the athletes' performances. During the closing ceremony, {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, a finalist in the sprint event, received applause for his advocacy work in promoting accessibility in sports technology and was awarded the {Paralympic Sports Innovation Award|EVENT-1}. {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, who has been a vocal advocate for adaptive sports since his debut in the {Paralympic Games|EVENT-1} in 2028, has worked with several organizations to improve accessibility in sports facilities. Organizer Vlad Petrovic, from the {International Sports Development Federation|ORGANIZATION-5}, emphasized the importance of inclusivity in sports innovation, stressing the role of organizations in providing platforms for diverse athletic expressions. The {International Sports Development Federation|ORGANIZATION-5}, founded in 2020, has been at the forefront of promoting inclusivity and diversity in global sports events. Following the successful event, plans for a comprehensive development program for {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} were discussed, aiming to introduce the sport in schools and community centers worldwide. The development program, set to launch in early 2031, will include training modules, equipment kits, and workshops designed to make {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} accessible to a broader audience.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2031-04-15</date><outline>The {Cresthaven School Board|PERSON-4} at its meeting on April 15, 2031, approved the integration of {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} into physical education programs across all public schools in the region. This decision marks a significant milestone in Cresthaven's commitment to inclusive education, reflecting a broader trend towards integrating adaptive sports into mainstream curricula. {Darlene Marstone|PERSON-1}, head of the {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, emphasized the importance of adapting sports curricula to promote inclusivity and encourage broader participation in adaptive sports. Marstone highlighted that the integration of {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} aligns with the committee's mission to enhance the lives of individuals with disabilities through pioneering sports technologies. The proposed curriculum includes a comprehensive module on the fundamentals of {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2}, featuring guidelines on the use of {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. The module will cover safety protocols, basic techniques, and the benefits of using {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, which are designed to enhance mobility and stability for athletes with physical challenges. An {informational session|EVENT-3} was conducted at {Cresthaven Community Center|LOCATION-4}, where students and teachers demonstrated the capabilities and safety features of the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1} developed by {TechVision Innovations|ORGANIZATION-4}. During the session, participants explored the gyroscopic stabilizers of the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, which allow athletes to maintain balance and control in water. {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, an influential advocate for adaptive sports, spoke at the session, highlighting the transformative potential of adaptive sports in schools and his hopes for increasing student engagement. Harris shared his vision of creating a more inclusive sports culture, where students of all abilities can participate and excel in adaptive sports. {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2} delivered a workshop for physical education teachers, instructing them on effectively coaching {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} techniques with diverse groups of students. Thorne's workshop included hands-on training sessions, where teachers practiced coaching techniques and learned how to adapt lessons for students with varying abilities. The first {pilot program|EVENT-4} of the curriculum began at {Cresthaven Primary School|LOCATION-3}, where equipment and trainers from {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3} provided on-site support and facilitated interactive lessons. At {Cresthaven Primary School|LOCATION-3}, students engaged in interactive lessons that focused on teamwork, coordination, and the joy of participating in a new sport. Local government representatives praised the initiative, asserting that the official endorsement by educational authorities signaled a significant step towards normalizing adaptive sports within mainstream education. Representatives emphasized that this initiative could serve as a model for other regions looking to integrate adaptive sports into their educational systems. Community feedback from early adopters of the program was overwhelmingly positive, with students expressing excitement about participating in a new sport and appreciating its inclusive nature. Students reported feeling more confident and motivated to participate in physical activities, highlighting the positive impact of the program on their overall well-being. Future community outreach events are planned by the {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1} to further encourage family and peer involvement in {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} activities. These events aim to foster a supportive community environment, where families can learn about adaptive sports and engage in activities together.</outline></event>",
