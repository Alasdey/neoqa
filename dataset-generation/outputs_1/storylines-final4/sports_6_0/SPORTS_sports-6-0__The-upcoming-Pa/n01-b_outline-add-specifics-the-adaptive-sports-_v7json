Review the outline of previous events that have occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n4. Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to {{NUM_SPECIFIC_SENTS}} novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre ({{GENRE}}) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre {{GENRE}}. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",

Review the outline of previous events that have occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n<event><date>2030-09-16</date><outline>On 16 September 2030, the {Paralympic Games|EVENT-1} opened with the inaugural presentation of a new sport named \"{HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2},\" designed specifically for athletes with limited upper body mobility, at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1} in {Tranquil Springs|LOCATION-2}. {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, renowned for its crystal-clear waters and gentle currents, has been a popular training ground for adaptive water sports athletes for over a decade. {Darlene Marstone|PERSON-1}, head of the {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, highlighted the collaborative efforts between biomechanical engineers and athletes to develop bespoke adaptive technology integrated into the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. The {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, established in 2025, has been pivotal in advancing adaptive sports technologies and fostering partnerships with leading engineering firms. In the preliminary rounds, solo athletes competed in 50-meter sprints, showcasing their precise balance and coordination while maneuvering the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1} equipment. The {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, equipped with gyroscopic stabilizers, allow athletes to maintain balance and control, even in challenging water conditions. Prevailing conditions at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, well-known for its calm waters, provided an ideal environment for stability and control, which were critical for the athletes during the competitions. The lake's consistent water temperature and minimal wave activity have made it a preferred location for adaptive sports events since its designation as a training site in 2028. {Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, the reigning champions in adaptive water sports, aimed to leverage their experience to excel in this new category by working with new recruits, many introduced to the sport only months prior. {Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, having won the {Adaptive Water Sports Championship|EVENT-2} three times consecutively, brought a wealth of experience and strategic insights to the {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2}.

Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: 2031-04-15\n<outline>\nThe Cresthaven School Board, at its meeting on April 15, 2031, approved the integration of HydroSlide Sprint into physical education programs across all public schools in the region.\nDarlene Marstone, head of the Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee, emphasized the importance of adapting sports curricula to promote inclusivity and encourage broader participation in adaptive sports.\nThe proposed curriculum includes a comprehensive module on the fundamentals of HydroSlide Sprint, featuring guidelines on the use of HydroSlide devices.\nAn informational session was conducted at Cresthaven Community Center, where students and teachers demonstrated the capabilities and safety features of the HydroSlide devices developed by TechVision Innovations.\nKaden Harris, an influential advocate for adaptive sports, spoke at the session, highlighting the transformative potential of adaptive sports in schools and his hopes for increasing student engagement.\nEliza Thorne delivered a workshop for physical education teachers, instructing them on effectively coaching HydroSlide Sprint techniques with diverse groups of students.\nThe first pilot program of the curriculum began at Cresthaven Primary School, where equipment and trainers from Team Lumina provided on-site support and facilitated interactive lessons.\nLocal government representatives praised the initiative, asserting that the official endorsement by educational authorities signaled a significant step towards normalizing adaptive sports within mainstream education.\nCommunity feedback from early adopters of the program was overwhelmingly positive, with students expressing excitement about participating in a new sport and appreciating its inclusive nature.\nFuture community outreach events are planned by the Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee to further encourage family and peer involvement in HydroSlide Sprint activities.\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to 2 novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre (Sports) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre Sports. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",

      "<event><date>2030-09-16</date><outline>On 16 September 2030, the {Paralympic Games|EVENT-1} opened with the inaugural presentation of a new sport named \"{HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2},\" designed specifically for athletes with limited upper body mobility, at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1} in {Tranquil Springs|LOCATION-2}. {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, renowned for its crystal-clear waters and gentle currents, has been a popular training ground for adaptive water sports athletes for over a decade. {Darlene Marstone|PERSON-1}, head of the {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, highlighted the collaborative efforts between biomechanical engineers and athletes to develop bespoke adaptive technology integrated into the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. The {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, established in 2025, has been pivotal in advancing adaptive sports technologies and fostering partnerships with leading engineering firms. In the preliminary rounds, solo athletes competed in 50-meter sprints, showcasing their precise balance and coordination while maneuvering the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1} equipment. The {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, equipped with gyroscopic stabilizers, allow athletes to maintain balance and control, even in challenging water conditions. Prevailing conditions at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, well-known for its calm waters, provided an ideal environment for stability and control, which were critical for the athletes during the competitions. The lake's consistent water temperature and minimal wave activity have made it a preferred location for adaptive sports events since its designation as a training site in 2028. {Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, the reigning champions in adaptive water sports, aimed to leverage their experience to excel in this new category by working with new recruits, many introduced to the sport only months prior. {Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, having won the {Adaptive Water Sports Championship|EVENT-2} three times consecutively, brought a wealth of experience and strategic insights to the {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2}.

    "HISTORY_XML": "<event><date>2030-09-16</date><outline>On 16 September 2030, the {Paralympic Games|EVENT-1} opened with the inaugural presentation of a new sport named \"{HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2},\" designed specifically for athletes with limited upper body mobility, at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1} in {Tranquil Springs|LOCATION-2}. {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, renowned for its crystal-clear waters and gentle currents, has been a popular training ground for adaptive water sports athletes for over a decade. {Darlene Marstone|PERSON-1}, head of the {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, highlighted the collaborative efforts between biomechanical engineers and athletes to develop bespoke adaptive technology integrated into the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. The {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, established in 2025, has been pivotal in advancing adaptive sports technologies and fostering partnerships with leading engineering firms. In the preliminary rounds, solo athletes competed in 50-meter sprints, showcasing their precise balance and coordination while maneuvering the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1} equipment. The {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, equipped with gyroscopic stabilizers, allow athletes to maintain balance and control, even in challenging water conditions. Prevailing conditions at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, well-known for its calm waters, provided an ideal environment for stability and control, which were critical for the athletes during the competitions. The lake's consistent water temperature and minimal wave activity have made it a preferred location for adaptive sports events since its designation as a training site in 2028. {Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, the reigning champions in adaptive water sports, aimed to leverage their experience to excel in this new category by working with new recruits, many introduced to the sport only months prior. {Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, having won the {Adaptive Water Sports Championship|EVENT-2} three times consecutively, brought a wealth of experience and strategic insights to the {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2}. Led by coach {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2}, {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3}, a recently assembled team formed from international elite long-standing wheelchair swimmers, showcased innovative techniques that combined agility with enhanced hydrodynamic designs. Coach {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2}, a former Paralympic swimmer with over 15 years of coaching experience, has been instrumental in developing {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3}'s unique training regimen. The {holographic scoreboard|PRODUCT-3} displaying live metrics and athlete performance analytics was appreciated by spectators for enhancing their understanding and enjoyment of the nuanced sport. The scoreboard, developed by {TechVision Innovations|ORGANIZATION-4}, provided real-time data on speed, trajectory, and balance, offering spectators a deeper insight into the athletes' performances. During the closing ceremony, {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, a finalist in the sprint event, received applause for his advocacy work in promoting accessibility in sports technology and was awarded the {Paralympic Sports Innovation Award|EVENT-1}. {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, who has been a vocal advocate for adaptive sports since his debut in the {Paralympic Games|EVENT-1} in 2028, has worked with several organizations to improve accessibility in sports facilities. Organizer Vlad Petrovic, from the {International Sports Development Federation|ORGANIZATION-5}, emphasized the importance of inclusivity in sports innovation, stressing the role of organizations in providing platforms for diverse athletic expressions. The {International Sports Development Federation|ORGANIZATION-5}, founded in 2020, has been at the forefront of promoting inclusivity and diversity in global sports events. Following the successful event, plans for a comprehensive development program for {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} were discussed, aiming to introduce the sport in schools and community centers worldwide. The development program, set to launch in early 2031, will include training modules, equipment kits, and workshops designed to make {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} accessible to a broader audience.</outline></event>",
