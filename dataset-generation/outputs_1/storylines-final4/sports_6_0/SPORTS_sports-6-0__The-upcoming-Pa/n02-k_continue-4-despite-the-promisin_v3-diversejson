  "instructions": "You are an AI tasked with creating fictional future news summaries based on provided information. Your goal is to generate plausible continuations of an existing narrative. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. First, you will be given known entities in this fictional world. These will be provided in the following format:\n<known_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</known_entities>\n\n2. Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. Your task is to create {{NUMBER_SUMMARIES}} new summaries that describe future fictional events following the last event from the <history>. These new summaries should be consistent with the existing story and represent plausible continuations or developments of the original narrative.\n\n4. For each summary, create:\n   a. A summary text (a single concise sentence)\n   b. The date on which this fictional next event happens\n\n5. Before starting, check if the history of events indicates specific dates for followup events. Ensure your continuations are consistent with these expected followup events. All your summaries must either concern this event, or happen before this event.\n\n6. Make sure that each summary you generate focuses on at least one of the main named entities from the history of events.\n\n7. Follow these guidelines when creating your summaries:\n   a. Ensure all summaries are fictional and not based on real events or real people.\n   b. Make the summaries sound realistic and plausible as follow-up stories to the previous outlines. \n   c. Think about plausible next events based on the fictional named entities, the history of the past fictional events and the genre {{GENRE}}. \n   d. Create summaries that are unbiased and objective in tone.\n   e. Each summary MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   f. Summaries may focus on different personas or organizations from the provided lists.\n   g. Ensure a balance of positive and negative news stories, developments, and alternative scenarios.\n   h. Consider various dimensions or personas that could be varied when generating diverse summaries.\n\nTry to be diverse in the summaries you generate. Consider different plausible substories and vary:\n- between impact: Try to create various low-impact next events, but you may also at times mix in an event with a slightly higher impact.\n- between directions: Vary between positive and negative story developments. Think about how stories in the {{GENRE}} genre progress in the real-world, NOT in a novel. Provide various realistic alternatives for how the story may progress in either direction.\n- between different key named entities of the fictional story.\n\n8. Output format:\n   - Enclose each summary in <summary> tags.\n   - Each summary must have two child properties:\n     <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n     <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n   - Before each summary, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Output everything within a <results> root node.\n\n9. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n10. Final reminders:\n   - Repeat this process for all {{NUMBER_SUMMARIES}} summaries.\n   - Ensure that each summary explores a different aspect or potential next step of the fictional situation presented in the HISTORY.\n   - Each summary text MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   - The continuations should be diverse in terms of high (at most one), medium and low impact, positive and negative story developments, etc., and can cover different alternatives of how the future event can play out.\n   - Do not enumerate over the summaries.\n   - When brainstorming future event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre {{GENRE}}. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event summaries while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative.\n\nHere's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[This includes the thought process for all summaries.]\n</thought_process>\n\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[Your first summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the first summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n<summary>\n<text>[Your second summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the second summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n[... continue for all summaries ...]\n</summaries>\n</results>",

The {Cresthaven Community Center|LOCATION-4} was selected as the location for the next information session to demonstrate alternative training exercises until more equipment is available. The session will include demonstrations of dry-land training techniques that can be practiced without the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. Council member {Lia Simmons|PERSON-5}, representing local government, pledged support in terms of temporary funding to ensure smooth implementation of interim solutions. Simmons announced a grant of $50,000 to cover the costs of alternative training equipment and materials for the interim period. Student feedback collected by {Cresthaven Primary School|LOCATION-3} indicated high enthusiasm for the {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} program despite logistical challenges, showing strong support for continued investment. Students expressed excitement about the potential for new friendships and personal growth through participation in the program.</outline></event>\n</history>\n\n3. Your task is to create 4 new summaries that describe future fictional events following the last event from the <history>. These new summaries should be consistent with the existing story and represent plausible continuations or developments of the original narrative.\n\n4. For each summary, create:\n   a. A summary text (a single concise sentence)\n   b. The date on which this fictional next event happens\n\n5. Before starting, check if the history of events indicates specific dates for followup events. Ensure your continuations are consistent with these expected followup events. All your summaries must either concern this event, or happen before this event.\n\n6. Make sure that each summary you generate focuses on at least one of the main named entities from the history of events.\n\n7. Follow these guidelines when creating your summaries:\n   a. Ensure all summaries are fictional and not based on real events or real people.\n   b. Make the summaries sound realistic and plausible as follow-up stories to the previous outlines. \n   c. Think about plausible next events based on the fictional named entities, the history of the past fictional events and the genre Sports. \n   d. Create summaries that are unbiased and objective in tone.\n   e. Each summary MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   f. Summaries may focus on different personas or organizations from the provided lists.\n   g. Ensure a balance of positive and negative news stories, developments, and alternative scenarios.\n   h. Consider various dimensions or personas that could be varied when generating diverse summaries.\n\nTry to be diverse in the summaries you generate. Consider different plausible substories and vary:\n- between impact: Try to create various low-impact next events, but you may also at times mix in an event with a slightly higher impact.\n- between directions: Vary between positive and negative story developments. Think about how stories in the Sports genre progress in the real-world, NOT in a novel. Provide various realistic alternatives for how the story may progress in either direction.\n- between different key named entities of the fictional story.\n\n8. Output format:\n   - Enclose each summary in <summary> tags.\n   - Each summary must have two child properties:\n     <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n     <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n   - Before each summary, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Output everything within a <results> root node.\n\n9. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n10. Final reminders:\n   - Repeat this process for all 4 summaries.\n   - Ensure that each summary explores a different aspect or potential next step of the fictional situation presented in the HISTORY.\n   - Each summary text MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   - The continuations should be diverse in terms of high (at most one), medium and low impact, positive and negative story developments, etc., and can cover different alternatives of how the future event can play out.\n   - Do not enumerate over the summaries.\n   - When brainstorming future event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre Sports. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event summaries while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative.\n\nHere's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[This includes the thought process for all summaries.]\n</thought_process>\n\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[Your first summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the first summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n<summary>\n<text>[Your second summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the second summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n[... continue for all summaries ...]\n</summaries>\n</results>",

In the preliminary rounds, solo athletes competed in 50-meter sprints, showcasing their precise balance and coordination while maneuvering the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1} equipment. The {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, equipped with gyroscopic stabilizers, allow athletes to maintain balance and control, even in challenging water conditions. Prevailing conditions at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1}, well-known for its calm waters, provided an ideal environment for stability and control, which were critical for the athletes during the competitions. The lake's consistent water temperature and minimal wave activity have made it a preferred location for adaptive sports events since its designation as a training site in 2028. {Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, the reigning champions in adaptive water sports, aimed to leverage their experience to excel in this new category by working with new recruits, many introduced to the sport only months prior. {Team Lunaris|ORGANIZATION-2}, having won the {Adaptive Water Sports Championship|EVENT-2} three times consecutively, brought a wealth of experience and strategic insights to the {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2}. Led by coach {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2}, {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3}, a recently assembled team formed from international elite long-standing wheelchair swimmers, showcased innovative techniques that combined agility with enhanced hydrodynamic designs. Coach {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2}, a former Paralympic swimmer with over 15 years of coaching experience, has been instrumental in developing {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3}'s unique training regimen. The {holographic scoreboard|PRODUCT-3} displaying live metrics and athlete performance analytics was appreciated by spectators for enhancing their understanding and enjoyment of the nuanced sport. The scoreboard, developed by {TechVision Innovations|ORGANIZATION-4}, provided real-time data on speed, trajectory, and balance, offering spectators a deeper insight into the athletes' performances. During the closing ceremony, {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, a finalist in the sprint event, received applause for his advocacy work in promoting accessibility in sports technology and was awarded the {Paralympic Sports Innovation Award|EVENT-1}. {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, who has been a vocal advocate for adaptive sports since his debut in the {Paralympic Games|EVENT-1} in 2028, has worked with several organizations to improve accessibility in sports facilities. Organizer Vlad Petrovic, from the {International Sports Development Federation|ORGANIZATION-5}, emphasized the importance of inclusivity in sports innovation, stressing the role of organizations in providing platforms for diverse athletic expressions. The {International Sports Development Federation|ORGANIZATION-5}, founded in 2020, has been at the forefront of promoting inclusivity and diversity in global sports events. Following the successful event, plans for a comprehensive development program for {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} were discussed, aiming to introduce the sport in schools and community centers worldwide. The development program, set to launch in early 2031, will include training modules, equipment kits, and workshops designed to make {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} accessible to a broader audience.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2031-04-15</date><outline>The {Cresthaven School Board|PERSON-4} at its meeting on April 15, 2031, approved the integration of {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} into physical education programs across all public schools in the region. This decision marks a significant milestone in Cresthaven's commitment to inclusive education, reflecting a broader trend towards integrating adaptive sports into mainstream curricula. {Darlene Marstone|PERSON-1}, head of the {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1}, emphasized the importance of adapting sports curricula to promote inclusivity and encourage broader participation in adaptive sports. Marstone highlighted that the integration of {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} aligns with the committee's mission to enhance the lives of individuals with disabilities through pioneering sports technologies. The proposed curriculum includes a comprehensive module on the fundamentals of {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2}, featuring guidelines on the use of {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. The module will cover safety protocols, basic techniques, and the benefits of using {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, which are designed to enhance mobility and stability for athletes with physical challenges. An {informational session|EVENT-3} was conducted at {Cresthaven Community Center|LOCATION-4}, where students and teachers demonstrated the capabilities and safety features of the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1} developed by {TechVision Innovations|ORGANIZATION-4}. During the session, participants explored the gyroscopic stabilizers of the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}, which allow athletes to maintain balance and control in water. {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3}, an influential advocate for adaptive sports, spoke at the session, highlighting the transformative potential of adaptive sports in schools and his hopes for increasing student engagement. Harris shared his vision of creating a more inclusive sports culture, where students of all abilities can participate and excel in adaptive sports. {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2} delivered a workshop for physical education teachers, instructing them on effectively coaching {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} techniques with diverse groups of students. Thorne's workshop included hands-on training sessions, where teachers practiced coaching techniques and learned how to adapt lessons for students with varying abilities. The first {pilot program|EVENT-4} of the curriculum began at {Cresthaven Primary School|LOCATION-3}, where equipment and trainers from {Team Lumina|ORGANIZATION-3} provided on-site support and facilitated interactive lessons. At {Cresthaven Primary School|LOCATION-3}, students engaged in interactive lessons that focused on teamwork, coordination, and the joy of participating in a new sport. Local government representatives praised the initiative, asserting that the official endorsement by educational authorities signaled a significant step towards normalizing adaptive sports within mainstream education. Representatives emphasized that this initiative could serve as a model for other regions looking to integrate adaptive sports into their educational systems. Community feedback from early adopters of the program was overwhelmingly positive, with students expressing excitement about participating in a new sport and appreciating its inclusive nature. Students reported feeling more confident and motivated to participate in physical activities, highlighting the positive impact of the program on their overall well-being. Future community outreach events are planned by the {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1} to further encourage family and peer involvement in {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} activities.

She suggested implementing a tracking system to monitor the progress of each shipment and ensure transparency with the schools. The {Adaptive Sports Innovations Committee|ORGANIZATION-1} highlighted that delays were primarily due to unforeseen production bottlenecks at the manufacturing facility. These bottlenecks were caused by a shortage of specialized components needed for the gyroscopic stabilizers in the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. {TechVision Innovations|ORGANIZATION-4} assured stakeholders that they had increased production capacity and aimed to resolve the shortage within the next two months. The company planned to hire additional staff and extend working hours to meet the increased demand for {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. {Eliza Thorne|PERSON-2} volunteered to help train additional coaches and volunteers to optimize the use of the limited {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1} currently available. Thorne proposed a series of weekend workshops at {Cresthaven Community Center|LOCATION-4} to quickly upskill coaches and volunteers. {Kaden Harris|PERSON-3} emphasized the importance of community engagement and proposed public outreach events to garner local support and additional resources. Harris suggested organizing a community fair at {Lake Serene|LOCATION-1} to showcase the benefits of adaptive sports and encourage local businesses to sponsor the program. The {Cresthaven Community Center|LOCATION-4} was selected as the location for the next information session to demonstrate alternative training exercises until more equipment is available. The session will include demonstrations of dry-land training techniques that can be practiced without the {HydroSlide devices|PRODUCT-1}. Council member {Lia Simmons|PERSON-5}, representing local government, pledged support in terms of temporary funding to ensure smooth implementation of interim solutions. Simmons announced a grant of $50,000 to cover the costs of alternative training equipment and materials for the interim period. Student feedback collected by {Cresthaven Primary School|LOCATION-3} indicated high enthusiasm for the {HydroSlide Sprint|PRODUCT-2} program despite logistical challenges, showing strong support for continued investment. Students expressed excitement about the potential for new friendships and personal growth through participation in the program.</outline></event>",
