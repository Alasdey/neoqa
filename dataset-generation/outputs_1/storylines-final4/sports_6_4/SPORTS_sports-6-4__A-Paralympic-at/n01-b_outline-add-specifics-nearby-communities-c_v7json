The {Linton Aquatics Championship|EVENT-1} is a prestigious event that attracts top adaptive athletes from around the region, celebrating excellence in adaptive sports. The competition took place at the newly constructed {AzureWave Complex|BUILDING-1} in Linton Harbor, a top-tier facility known for its advanced adaptive sports programs. The {AzureWave Complex|BUILDING-1}, designed by renowned architect {Elena Vasquez|PERSON-2}, features state-of-the-art aquatic technology and accessibility features, making it a model for future sports facilities. {Fontaine}'s remarkable performance, clocking a time of 52.34 seconds in the 100-meter freestyle, credited to innovative training methods developed by the {Linton Adaptive Sports Association|ORGANIZATION-1}. These training methods incorporate a unique blend of aquatic resistance training and personalized biomechanical analysis, tailored to enhance each athlete's performance. Head coach {Dr. Marcus Eldridge|PERSON-3} explained, \"Our cutting-edge regimens focus on biomechanics and energy efficiency, tailored specifically for adaptive athletes.\" {Dr. Marcus Eldridge|PERSON-3}, a former Paralympic swimmer himself, has been instrumental in developing these regimens, drawing from his extensive experience in adaptive sports. {Linton Adaptive Sports Association|ORGANIZATION-1}, led by Director {Linnea Hart|PERSON-4}, praised {Fontaine}'s dedication and the positive example set for aspiring athletes. Director {Linnea Hart|PERSON-4}, who has been with the association for over a decade, emphasized the importance of community support in nurturing young adaptive athletes. \"Achieving this record inspires future athletes to push boundaries with new training techniques,\" {Hart} stated in a post-event press conference. The event drew media attention nationwide, with sportswear brand {veloX|ORGANIZATION-2} admiringly sponsoring the athlete and her accomplishments. {veloX|ORGANIZATION-2}, known for its commitment to innovation in sportswear, has been a long-time supporter of adaptive sports, providing cutting-edge equipment to athletes. {Fontaine} acknowledged the support from {veloX|ORGANIZATION-2}, emphasizing, \"Their innovative swimwear has contributed to my performance by enhancing hydrodynamics and comfort.\" The {veloX|ORGANIZATION-2} swimwear, featuring a patented hydrodynamic fabric, reduces drag and increases buoyancy, offering a competitive edge to swimmers. The ceremony commemorating the new record was attended by key figures, including {Michaela Lyons|PERSON-5}, Secretary of Sports and Culture at the {Commonwealth Department of Health|ORGANIZATION-3}. {Michaela Lyons|PERSON-5}, who has been advocating for increased funding for adaptive sports, highlighted the event's role in promoting inclusivity in athletics. {Lyons} emphasized the importance of adaptive sports at a conference held at nearby {Redcliff University|ORGANIZATION-4}, highlighting the athlete's achievements as instrumental in advancing public health initiatives.

Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to 2 novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences.

Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre (Sports) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre Sports. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",
