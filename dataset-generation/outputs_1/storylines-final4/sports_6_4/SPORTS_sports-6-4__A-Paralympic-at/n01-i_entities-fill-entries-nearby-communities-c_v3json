  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with creating fictional entities based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate detailed, coherent, and realistic descriptions for new locations, persons, organizations, products, art, buildings, events, and miscellaneous entities. \nFollow these instructions carefully:\n\n1.

Carefully read the provided outline:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\nBased on the information provided, create detailed descriptions for each new entity following these guidelines:\n\nGeneral instructions:\n- Ensure all created entities are entirely fictional and not similar to any real or known fictional entities.\n- Maintain realism and coherence with the provided outline and other entities.\n- Create a believable and consistent fictional world that aligns with the context of the outline.\n- For entity descriptions, focus on providing a solid background that remains valid throughout the story, rather than basing it centrally on the outline itself.\n- Develop well-rounded entities with backgrounds and characteristics that can support various potential story developments beyond the specific outline provided.\n- Strictly derive all entities from the outline. Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the outline.\n- Do not alter the name of the entities.\n- Some properties (e.g., place, city, country, spouse, architect, country, nationality) must be filled with named entities. Make sure to use FICTIONAL named entities ( fictional places, cities, countries, spouse names, architects, countries, nationalities, etc.). Check if you should use one of the existing fictional named entities (from <new_entity_names> and <existing_entities>) or create a fictional name instead. DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic. If global impact isn\u2019t necessary, adjust the details to be more modest and appropriate.\n\nSpecific instructions for each entity type:\n\n1.

These training methods incorporate a unique blend of aquatic resistance training and personalized biomechanical analysis, tailored to enhance each athlete's performance. Head coach {Dr. Marcus Eldridge|PERSON-3} explained, \"Our cutting-edge regimens focus on biomechanics and energy efficiency, tailored specifically for adaptive athletes.\" {Dr. Marcus Eldridge|PERSON-3}, a former Paralympic swimmer himself, has been instrumental in developing these regimens, drawing from his extensive experience in adaptive sports. {Linton Adaptive Sports Association|ORGANIZATION-1}, led by Director {Linnea Hart|PERSON-4}, praised {Fontaine}'s dedication and the positive example set for aspiring athletes.
