An outline describing the next fictional event:\n<outline>\n{{STORYITEM_XML}}\n</outline>\n\nFollow these steps to complete your task:\n\n1. Carefully compare the events described in the outline with the events from the history. Look for any inconsistencies or contradictions.\n\n2. Compare the named entities described in the outline with the list of provided named entities. Ensure they are consistent.\n\n3. Note that changes to known named entities are acceptable if they are reasonably discussed within the outline.\n\n4. If you find any inconsistencies or contradictions:\n   a. Make minimal changes to the outline to resolve the issues.\n   b. Ensure your changes maintain the original structure and flow of the outline as much as possible.\n   c. Double-check after fixing the inconsistencies to ensure they no longer persist.\n\n5.
