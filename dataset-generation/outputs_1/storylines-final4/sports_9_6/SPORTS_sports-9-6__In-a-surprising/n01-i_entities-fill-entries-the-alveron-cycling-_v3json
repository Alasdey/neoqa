Carefully read the provided outline:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\nBased on the information provided, create detailed descriptions for each new entity following these guidelines:\n\nGeneral instructions:\n- Ensure all created entities are entirely fictional and not similar to any real or known fictional entities.\n- Maintain realism and coherence with the provided outline and other entities.\n- Create a believable and consistent fictional world that aligns with the context of the outline.\n- For entity descriptions, focus on providing a solid background that remains valid throughout the story, rather than basing it centrally on the outline itself.\n- Develop well-rounded entities with backgrounds and characteristics that can support various potential story developments beyond the specific outline provided.\n- Strictly derive all entities from the outline. Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the outline.\n- Do not alter the name of the entities.\n- Some properties (e.g., place, city, country, spouse, architect, country, nationality) must be filled with named entities. Make sure to use FICTIONAL named entities ( fictional places, cities, countries, spouse names, architects, countries, nationalities, etc.). Check if you should use one of the existing fictional named entities (from <new_entity_names> and <existing_entities>) or create a fictional name instead. DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic.
