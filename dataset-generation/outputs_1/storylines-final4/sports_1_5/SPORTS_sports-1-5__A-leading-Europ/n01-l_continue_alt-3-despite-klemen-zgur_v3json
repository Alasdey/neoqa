  "instructions": "You are an AI tasked with creating alternative fictional future news summaries based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate summaries of plausible alternative continuations of an existing narrative. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. First, you will be given known entities in this fictional world:\n\n<known_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</known_entities>\n\n2. Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>{{CONTINUATION_TEXT}}</text>\n<date>{{CONTINUATION_DATE}}</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create {{NUM_ALTERNATIVES}} contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre {{GENRE}}. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n<event><date>2024-03-15</date><outline>VBK \u017daladar {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} of {Slovenia|LOCATION-1} announced the transfer of 18-year-old prospect {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} to {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} of the {Korean Basketball League|ORGANIZATION-3} for an undisclosed fee. The transfer fee is reported to be in the range of \u20ac200,000 to \u20ac300,000, with potential bonuses tied to {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s performance milestones. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}, who averaged 12.5 points per game in {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s developmental league, expressed excitement about the opportunity to compete in {Asia|LOCATION-3}'s fastest-growing basketball market. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s impressive 3-point shooting percentage of 38% and his ability to play both guard positions made him a standout prospect in the Slovenian youth system. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}' General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} stated that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s exceptional ball-handling skills and 6'7\" frame made him an ideal addition to the team's roster. The Lions, currently sitting in fourth place in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} standings, have been seeking a reliable playmaker to complement their strong frontcourt. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director, {David Cimerman|PERSON-3}, confirmed that the transfer includes a buy-back clause after two seasons, allowing the club to monitor {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s development in the Asian league. The buy-back clause is set at \u20ac500,000 and includes performance-based escalators if {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} achieves certain statistical benchmarks in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3}. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} praised {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} for creating innovative pathways for young players, citing the transfer as a milestone for the country's basketball development program. The federation has already initiated discussions with other Asian leagues to establish similar development pathways for Slovenian prospects. Korean sports media reported that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} will wear jersey number 7 for {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} and is expected to make his debut against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} in March 2024. The number 7 jersey was previously worn by the team's most popular player, {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4}, who retired last season. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth academy director, {Ana Novak|PERSON-5}, revealed that the club has already identified two more promising prospects for potential future transfers to Asian leagues. Both prospects, aged 16 and 17, are currently participating in a cultural exchange program with a {Japan|LOCATION-4}ese basketball academy to prepare them for potential moves to {Asia|LOCATION-3}. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a special pre-season exhibition game against {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} in {Slovenia|LOCATION-1}, scheduled for September 2024, to celebrate the partnership between the clubs. The exhibition game will be played at the 5,000-seat {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} in {Ljubljana|LOCATION-5}, with tickets expected to sell out within days of release. Korean basketball analysts noted that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s arrival could help {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} address their need for a skilled playmaker ahead of their {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} playoff push. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s addition is expected to reduce the workload of veteran point guard {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, who has been averaging 35 minutes per game this season. The transfer marks the first significant player exchange between Slovenian and {Korea|LOCATION-2}n basketball leagues, potentially opening doors for future collaborations between the two national basketball associations. The two basketball associations have already scheduled a joint coaching clinic for June 2024, focusing on youth development and tactical strategies.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2024-04-15</date><outline>{Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s debut game against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} opened with {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} receiving a warm welcome from the home crowd at {Lions Arena|BUILDING-2}. The crowd of 4,500 fans gave {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} a standing ovation as he was introduced with the starting lineup, with many holding signs reading \"Welcome to Seoul, Klemen!\" {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} demonstrated his playmaking skills early, dishing out 4 assists in the first quarter, including a precise behind-the-back pass to {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} for an easy layup. The assist to {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} came at the 7:23 mark of the first quarter, with {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} threading the ball through a tight defensive gap to find his teammate cutting to the basket. {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5}'s aggressive defense forced {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} into 8 turnovers in the second quarter, leading to a 12-point deficit at halftime. {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5}'s defensive strategy focused on pressuring {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} whenever he crossed half-court, forcing him to make quick decisions with the ball. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} scored 8 of his 12 total points in the third quarter, sparking a comeback that brought {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} within 4 points with 2 minutes remaining.

You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>Following his impressive debut, Klemen \u017dgur scored 15 points and recorded 6 assists in his second game with Seoul Metro Lions, helping the team defeat Incheon Elephants 88-76.</text>\n<date>2024-04-18</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create 3 contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre Sports. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

The transfer fee is reported to be in the range of \u20ac200,000 to \u20ac300,000, with potential bonuses tied to {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s performance milestones. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}, who averaged 12.5 points per game in {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s developmental league, expressed excitement about the opportunity to compete in {Asia|LOCATION-3}'s fastest-growing basketball market. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s impressive 3-point shooting percentage of 38% and his ability to play both guard positions made him a standout prospect in the Slovenian youth system. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}' General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} stated that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s exceptional ball-handling skills and 6'7\" frame made him an ideal addition to the team's roster. The Lions, currently sitting in fourth place in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} standings, have been seeking a reliable playmaker to complement their strong frontcourt. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director, {David Cimerman|PERSON-3}, confirmed that the transfer includes a buy-back clause after two seasons, allowing the club to monitor {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s development in the Asian league. The buy-back clause is set at \u20ac500,000 and includes performance-based escalators if {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} achieves certain statistical benchmarks in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3}. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} praised {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} for creating innovative pathways for young players, citing the transfer as a milestone for the country's basketball development program. The federation has already initiated discussions with other Asian leagues to establish similar development pathways for Slovenian prospects. Korean sports media reported that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} will wear jersey number 7 for {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} and is expected to make his debut against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} in March 2024. The number 7 jersey was previously worn by the team's most popular player, {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4}, who retired last season. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth academy director, {Ana Novak|PERSON-5}, revealed that the club has already identified two more promising prospects for potential future transfers to Asian leagues. Both prospects, aged 16 and 17, are currently participating in a cultural exchange program with a {Japan|LOCATION-4}ese basketball academy to prepare them for potential moves to {Asia|LOCATION-3}. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a special pre-season exhibition game against {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} in {Slovenia|LOCATION-1}, scheduled for September 2024, to celebrate the partnership between the clubs. The exhibition game will be played at the 5,000-seat {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} in {Ljubljana|LOCATION-5}, with tickets expected to sell out within days of release. Korean basketball analysts noted that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s arrival could help {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} address their need for a skilled playmaker ahead of their {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} playoff push. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s addition is expected to reduce the workload of veteran point guard {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, who has been averaging 35 minutes per game this season.

The transfer fee is reported to be in the range of \u20ac200,000 to \u20ac300,000, with potential bonuses tied to {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s performance milestones. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}, who averaged 12.5 points per game in {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s developmental league, expressed excitement about the opportunity to compete in {Asia|LOCATION-3}'s fastest-growing basketball market. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s impressive 3-point shooting percentage of 38% and his ability to play both guard positions made him a standout prospect in the Slovenian youth system. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}' General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} stated that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s exceptional ball-handling skills and 6'7\" frame made him an ideal addition to the team's roster. The Lions, currently sitting in fourth place in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} standings, have been seeking a reliable playmaker to complement their strong frontcourt. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director, {David Cimerman|PERSON-3}, confirmed that the transfer includes a buy-back clause after two seasons, allowing the club to monitor {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s development in the Asian league. The buy-back clause is set at \u20ac500,000 and includes performance-based escalators if {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} achieves certain statistical benchmarks in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3}. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} praised {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} for creating innovative pathways for young players, citing the transfer as a milestone for the country's basketball development program. The federation has already initiated discussions with other Asian leagues to establish similar development pathways for Slovenian prospects. Korean sports media reported that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} will wear jersey number 7 for {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} and is expected to make his debut against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} in March 2024. The number 7 jersey was previously worn by the team's most popular player, {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4}, who retired last season. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth academy director, {Ana Novak|PERSON-5}, revealed that the club has already identified two more promising prospects for potential future transfers to Asian leagues. Both prospects, aged 16 and 17, are currently participating in a cultural exchange program with a {Japan|LOCATION-4}ese basketball academy to prepare them for potential moves to {Asia|LOCATION-3}. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a special pre-season exhibition game against {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} in {Slovenia|LOCATION-1}, scheduled for September 2024, to celebrate the partnership between the clubs. The exhibition game will be played at the 5,000-seat {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} in {Ljubljana|LOCATION-5}, with tickets expected to sell out within days of release. Korean basketball analysts noted that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s arrival could help {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} address their need for a skilled playmaker ahead of their {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} playoff push. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s addition is expected to reduce the workload of veteran point guard {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, who has been averaging 35 minutes per game this season. The transfer marks the first significant player exchange between Slovenian and {Korea|LOCATION-2}n basketball leagues, potentially opening doors for future collaborations between the two national basketball associations. The two basketball associations have already scheduled a joint coaching clinic for June 2024, focusing on youth development and tactical strategies.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2024-04-15</date><outline>{Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s debut game against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} opened with {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} receiving a warm welcome from the home crowd at {Lions Arena|BUILDING-2}.
