Review the outline of previous events that have occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n4. Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to {{NUM_SPECIFIC_SENTS}} novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre ({{GENRE}}) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre {{GENRE}}. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",

The transfer fee is reported to be in the range of \u20ac200,000 to \u20ac300,000, with potential bonuses tied to {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s performance milestones. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}, who averaged 12.5 points per game in {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s developmental league, expressed excitement about the opportunity to compete in {Asia|LOCATION-3}'s fastest-growing basketball market. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s impressive 3-point shooting percentage of 38% and his ability to play both guard positions made him a standout prospect in the Slovenian youth system. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}' General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} stated that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s exceptional ball-handling skills and 6'7\" frame made him an ideal addition to the team's roster. The Lions, currently sitting in fourth place in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} standings, have been seeking a reliable playmaker to complement their strong frontcourt. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director, {David Cimerman|PERSON-3}, confirmed that the transfer includes a buy-back clause after two seasons, allowing the club to monitor {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s development in the Asian league. The buy-back clause is set at \u20ac500,000 and includes performance-based escalators if {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} achieves certain statistical benchmarks in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3}. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} praised {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} for creating innovative pathways for young players, citing the transfer as a milestone for the country's basketball development program. The federation has already initiated discussions with other Asian leagues to establish similar development pathways for Slovenian prospects. Korean sports media reported that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} will wear jersey number 7 for {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} and is expected to make his debut against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} in March 2024.

The exhibition game will be played at the 5,000-seat {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} in {Ljubljana|LOCATION-5}, with tickets expected to sell out within days of release. Korean basketball analysts noted that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s arrival could help {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} address their need for a skilled playmaker ahead of their {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} playoff push. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s addition is expected to reduce the workload of veteran point guard {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, who has been averaging 35 minutes per game this season. The transfer marks the first significant player exchange between Slovenian and {Korea|LOCATION-2}n basketball leagues, potentially opening doors for future collaborations between the two national basketball associations.
