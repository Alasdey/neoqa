      "<event><date>2024-03-15</date><outline>VBK \u017daladar {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} of {Slovenia|LOCATION-1} announced the transfer of 18-year-old prospect {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} to {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} of the {Korean Basketball League|ORGANIZATION-3} for an undisclosed fee. The transfer fee is reported to be in the range of \u20ac200,000 to \u20ac300,000, with potential bonuses tied to {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s performance milestones. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}, who averaged 12.5 points per game in {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s developmental league, expressed excitement about the opportunity to compete in {Asia|LOCATION-3}'s fastest-growing basketball market. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s impressive 3-point shooting percentage of 38% and his ability to play both guard positions made him a standout prospect in the Slovenian youth system. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}' General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} stated that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s exceptional ball-handling skills and 6'7\" frame made him an ideal addition to the team's roster. The Lions, currently sitting in fourth place in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} standings, have been seeking a reliable playmaker to complement their strong frontcourt. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director, {David Cimerman|PERSON-3}, confirmed that the transfer includes a buy-back clause after two seasons, allowing the club to monitor {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s development in the Asian league. The buy-back clause is set at \u20ac500,000 and includes performance-based escalators if {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} achieves certain statistical benchmarks in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3}. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} praised {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} for creating innovative pathways for young players, citing the transfer as a milestone for the country's basketball development program. The federation has already initiated discussions with other Asian leagues to establish similar development pathways for Slovenian prospects. Korean sports media reported that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} will wear jersey number 7 for {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} and is expected to make his debut against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} in March 2024. The number 7 jersey was previously worn by the team's most popular player, {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4}, who retired last season. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth academy director, {Ana Novak|PERSON-5}, revealed that the club has already identified two more promising prospects for potential future transfers to Asian leagues. Both prospects, aged 16 and 17, are currently participating in a cultural exchange program with a {Japan|LOCATION-4}ese basketball academy to prepare them for potential moves to {Asia|LOCATION-3}. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a special pre-season exhibition game against {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} in {Slovenia|LOCATION-1}, scheduled for September 2024, to celebrate the partnership between the clubs. The exhibition game will be played at the 5,000-seat {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} in {Ljubljana|LOCATION-5}, with tickets expected to sell out within days of release. Korean basketball analysts noted that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s arrival could help {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} address their need for a skilled playmaker ahead of their {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} playoff push. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s addition is expected to reduce the workload of veteran point guard {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, who has been averaging 35 minutes per game this season. The transfer marks the first significant player exchange between Slovenian and {Korea|LOCATION-2}n basketball leagues, potentially opening doors for future collaborations between the two national basketball associations. The two basketball associations have already scheduled a joint coaching clinic for June 2024, focusing on youth development and tactical strategies.</outline></event>",
      "<event><date>2024-04-15</date><outline>{Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s debut game against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} opened with {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} receiving a warm welcome from the home crowd at {Lions Arena|BUILDING-2}. The crowd of 4,500 fans gave {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} a standing ovation as he was introduced with the starting lineup, with many holding signs reading \"Welcome to Seoul, Klemen!\" {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} demonstrated his playmaking skills early, dishing out 4 assists in the first quarter, including a precise behind-the-back pass to {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} for an easy layup. The assist to {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} came at the 7:23 mark of the first quarter, with {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} threading the ball through a tight defensive gap to find his teammate cutting to the basket. {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5}'s aggressive defense forced {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} into 8 turnovers in the second quarter, leading to a 12-point deficit at halftime. {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5}'s defensive strategy focused on pressuring {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} whenever he crossed half-court, forcing him to make quick decisions with the ball. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} scored 8 of his 12 total points in the third quarter, sparking a comeback that brought {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} within 4 points with 2 minutes remaining. His scoring run included two three-pointers and a driving layup, with {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} showing particular effectiveness when operating in pick-and-roll situations with center {Lee Min-ho|PERSON-7}. {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2}, General Manager of {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}, praised {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s court vision but acknowledged the team's need to \"finish plays\" in crucial moments. \"\"{Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} showed exactly why we brought him here - his vision and passing ability are exceptional,\"\" {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} said in the post-game press conference. {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} secured the win 82-78 after {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s shooters missed three wide-open three-point attempts in the final minute. The final minute saw {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} attempt three three-pointers from beyond the arc, with {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} and {Lee Min-ho|PERSON-7} both missing open looks from the corner. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s teammate {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} struggled with his shooting, converting only 2 of 7 field goal attempts despite receiving quality passes from {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}. {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}'s shooting woes included two missed layups in transition and a pair of contested jumpers in the final quarter, despite {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} creating good scoring opportunities. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director {David Cimerman|PERSON-3} contacted {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s coaching staff to discuss {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s integration into the team's offense. {David Cimerman|PERSON-3} specifically inquired about {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s minutes distribution and his role in the team's offensive sets, expressing satisfaction with the 32 minutes he played in his debut. {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4}, {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s former star player, praised {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s composure in his debut, noting that \"he'll only get better with more experience.\" \"\"I was impressed by how {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} handled the pressure of his first game in a new league,\"\" {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4} commented during his post-game analysis on {KBL TV|ORGANIZATION-6}. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a post-game analysis session where {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} and {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} will work on refining their chemistry in pick-and-roll situations. The session, scheduled for the following day, will focus on timing and communication between {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} and {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, with video analysis of their pick-and-roll execution from the game.</outline></event>"

    "HISTORY_XML": "<event><date>2024-03-15</date><outline>VBK \u017daladar {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} of {Slovenia|LOCATION-1} announced the transfer of 18-year-old prospect {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} to {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} of the {Korean Basketball League|ORGANIZATION-3} for an undisclosed fee. The transfer fee is reported to be in the range of \u20ac200,000 to \u20ac300,000, with potential bonuses tied to {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s performance milestones. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}, who averaged 12.5 points per game in {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s developmental league, expressed excitement about the opportunity to compete in {Asia|LOCATION-3}'s fastest-growing basketball market. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s impressive 3-point shooting percentage of 38% and his ability to play both guard positions made him a standout prospect in the Slovenian youth system. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}' General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} stated that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s exceptional ball-handling skills and 6'7\" frame made him an ideal addition to the team's roster. The Lions, currently sitting in fourth place in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} standings, have been seeking a reliable playmaker to complement their strong frontcourt. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director, {David Cimerman|PERSON-3}, confirmed that the transfer includes a buy-back clause after two seasons, allowing the club to monitor {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s development in the Asian league. The buy-back clause is set at \u20ac500,000 and includes performance-based escalators if {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} achieves certain statistical benchmarks in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3}. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} praised {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} for creating innovative pathways for young players, citing the transfer as a milestone for the country's basketball development program. The federation has already initiated discussions with other Asian leagues to establish similar development pathways for Slovenian prospects. Korean sports media reported that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} will wear jersey number 7 for {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} and is expected to make his debut against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} in March 2024. The number 7 jersey was previously worn by the team's most popular player, {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4}, who retired last season. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth academy director, {Ana Novak|PERSON-5}, revealed that the club has already identified two more promising prospects for potential future transfers to Asian leagues. Both prospects, aged 16 and 17, are currently participating in a cultural exchange program with a {Japan|LOCATION-4}ese basketball academy to prepare them for potential moves to {Asia|LOCATION-3}. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a special pre-season exhibition game against {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} in {Slovenia|LOCATION-1}, scheduled for September 2024, to celebrate the partnership between the clubs. The exhibition game will be played at the 5,000-seat {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} in {Ljubljana|LOCATION-5}, with tickets expected to sell out within days of release. Korean basketball analysts noted that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s arrival could help {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} address their need for a skilled playmaker ahead of their {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} playoff push. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s addition is expected to reduce the workload of veteran point guard {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, who has been averaging 35 minutes per game this season. The transfer marks the first significant player exchange between Slovenian and {Korea|LOCATION-2}n basketball leagues, potentially opening doors for future collaborations between the two national basketball associations. The two basketball associations have already scheduled a joint coaching clinic for June 2024, focusing on youth development and tactical strategies.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2024-04-15</date><outline>{Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s debut game against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} opened with {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} receiving a warm welcome from the home crowd at {Lions Arena|BUILDING-2}. The crowd of 4,500 fans gave {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} a standing ovation as he was introduced with the starting lineup, with many holding signs reading \"Welcome to Seoul, Klemen!\" {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} demonstrated his playmaking skills early, dishing out 4 assists in the first quarter, including a precise behind-the-back pass to {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} for an easy layup. The assist to {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} came at the 7:23 mark of the first quarter, with {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} threading the ball through a tight defensive gap to find his teammate cutting to the basket. {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5}'s aggressive defense forced {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} into 8 turnovers in the second quarter, leading to a 12-point deficit at halftime. {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5}'s defensive strategy focused on pressuring {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} whenever he crossed half-court, forcing him to make quick decisions with the ball. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} scored 8 of his 12 total points in the third quarter, sparking a comeback that brought {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} within 4 points with 2 minutes remaining. His scoring run included two three-pointers and a driving layup, with {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} showing particular effectiveness when operating in pick-and-roll situations with center {Lee Min-ho|PERSON-7}. {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2}, General Manager of {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}, praised {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s court vision but acknowledged the team's need to \"finish plays\" in crucial moments. \"\"{Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} showed exactly why we brought him here - his vision and passing ability are exceptional,\"\" {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} said in the post-game press conference. {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} secured the win 82-78 after {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s shooters missed three wide-open three-point attempts in the final minute. The final minute saw {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} attempt three three-pointers from beyond the arc, with {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} and {Lee Min-ho|PERSON-7} both missing open looks from the corner. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s teammate {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} struggled with his shooting, converting only 2 of 7 field goal attempts despite receiving quality passes from {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}. {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}'s shooting woes included two missed layups in transition and a pair of contested jumpers in the final quarter, despite {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} creating good scoring opportunities. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director {David Cimerman|PERSON-3} contacted {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s coaching staff to discuss {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s integration into the team's offense. {David Cimerman|PERSON-3} specifically inquired about {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s minutes distribution and his role in the team's offensive sets, expressing satisfaction with the 32 minutes he played in his debut. {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4}, {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s former star player, praised {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s composure in his debut, noting that \"he'll only get better with more experience.\" \"\"I was impressed by how {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} handled the pressure of his first game in a new league,\"\" {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4} commented during his post-game analysis on {KBL TV|ORGANIZATION-6}. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a post-game analysis session where {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} and {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} will work on refining their chemistry in pick-and-roll situations. The session, scheduled for the following day, will focus on timing and communication between {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} and {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, with video analysis of their pick-and-roll execution from the game.</outline></event>",
