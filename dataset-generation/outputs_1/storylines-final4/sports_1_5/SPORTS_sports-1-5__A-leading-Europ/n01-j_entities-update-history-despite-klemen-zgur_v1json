The transfer fee is reported to be in the range of \u20ac200,000 to \u20ac300,000, with potential bonuses tied to {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s performance milestones. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}, who averaged 12.5 points per game in {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s developmental league, expressed excitement about the opportunity to compete in {Asia|LOCATION-3}'s fastest-growing basketball market. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s impressive 3-point shooting percentage of 38% and his ability to play both guard positions made him a standout prospect in the Slovenian youth system. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}' General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} stated that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s exceptional ball-handling skills and 6'7\" frame made him an ideal addition to the team's roster. The Lions, currently sitting in fourth place in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} standings, have been seeking a reliable playmaker to complement their strong frontcourt. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director, {David Cimerman|PERSON-3}, confirmed that the transfer includes a buy-back clause after two seasons, allowing the club to monitor {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s development in the Asian league. The buy-back clause is set at \u20ac500,000 and includes performance-based escalators if {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} achieves certain statistical benchmarks in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3}. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} praised {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} for creating innovative pathways for young players, citing the transfer as a milestone for the country's basketball development program. The federation has already initiated discussions with other Asian leagues to establish similar development pathways for Slovenian prospects. Korean sports media reported that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} will wear jersey number 7 for {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} and is expected to make his debut against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} in March 2024. The number 7 jersey was previously worn by the team's most popular player, {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4}, who retired last season. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth academy director, {Ana Novak|PERSON-5}, revealed that the club has already identified two more promising prospects for potential future transfers to Asian leagues. Both prospects, aged 16 and 17, are currently participating in a cultural exchange program with a {Japan|LOCATION-4}ese basketball academy to prepare them for potential moves to {Asia|LOCATION-3}. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a special pre-season exhibition game against {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} in {Slovenia|LOCATION-1}, scheduled for September 2024, to celebrate the partnership between the clubs. The exhibition game will be played at the 5,000-seat {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} in {Ljubljana|LOCATION-5}, with tickets expected to sell out within days of release. Korean basketball analysts noted that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s arrival could help {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} address their need for a skilled playmaker ahead of their {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} playoff push. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s addition is expected to reduce the workload of veteran point guard {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, who has been averaging 35 minutes per game this season. The transfer marks the first significant player exchange between Slovenian and {Korea|LOCATION-2}n basketball leagues, potentially opening doors for future collaborations between the two national basketball associations. The two basketball associations have already scheduled a joint coaching clinic for June 2024, focusing on youth development and tactical strategies.</outline></event>"

    "HISTORY_XML": "<event><date>2024-03-15</date><outline>VBK \u017daladar {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} of {Slovenia|LOCATION-1} announced the transfer of 18-year-old prospect {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} to {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} of the {Korean Basketball League|ORGANIZATION-3} for an undisclosed fee. The transfer fee is reported to be in the range of \u20ac200,000 to \u20ac300,000, with potential bonuses tied to {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s performance milestones. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}, who averaged 12.5 points per game in {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s developmental league, expressed excitement about the opportunity to compete in {Asia|LOCATION-3}'s fastest-growing basketball market. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s impressive 3-point shooting percentage of 38% and his ability to play both guard positions made him a standout prospect in the Slovenian youth system. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}' General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} stated that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s exceptional ball-handling skills and 6'7\" frame made him an ideal addition to the team's roster. The Lions, currently sitting in fourth place in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} standings, have been seeking a reliable playmaker to complement their strong frontcourt. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director, {David Cimerman|PERSON-3}, confirmed that the transfer includes a buy-back clause after two seasons, allowing the club to monitor {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s development in the Asian league. The buy-back clause is set at \u20ac500,000 and includes performance-based escalators if {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} achieves certain statistical benchmarks in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3}. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} praised {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} for creating innovative pathways for young players, citing the transfer as a milestone for the country's basketball development program. The federation has already initiated discussions with other Asian leagues to establish similar development pathways for Slovenian prospects. Korean sports media reported that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} will wear jersey number 7 for {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} and is expected to make his debut against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} in March 2024. The number 7 jersey was previously worn by the team's most popular player, {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4}, who retired last season. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth academy director, {Ana Novak|PERSON-5}, revealed that the club has already identified two more promising prospects for potential future transfers to Asian leagues. Both prospects, aged 16 and 17, are currently participating in a cultural exchange program with a {Japan|LOCATION-4}ese basketball academy to prepare them for potential moves to {Asia|LOCATION-3}. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a special pre-season exhibition game against {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} in {Slovenia|LOCATION-1}, scheduled for September 2024, to celebrate the partnership between the clubs. The exhibition game will be played at the 5,000-seat {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} in {Ljubljana|LOCATION-5}, with tickets expected to sell out within days of release. Korean basketball analysts noted that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s arrival could help {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} address their need for a skilled playmaker ahead of their {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} playoff push. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s addition is expected to reduce the workload of veteran point guard {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, who has been averaging 35 minutes per game this season. The transfer marks the first significant player exchange between Slovenian and {Korea|LOCATION-2}n basketball leagues, potentially opening doors for future collaborations between the two national basketball associations. The two basketball associations have already scheduled a joint coaching clinic for June 2024, focusing on youth development and tactical strategies.</outline></event>",
