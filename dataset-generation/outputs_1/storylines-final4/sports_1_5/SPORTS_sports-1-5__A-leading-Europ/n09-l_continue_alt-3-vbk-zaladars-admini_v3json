  "instructions": "You are an AI tasked with creating alternative fictional future news summaries based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate summaries of plausible alternative continuations of an existing narrative. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. First, you will be given known entities in this fictional world:\n\n<known_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</known_entities>\n\n2. Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>{{CONTINUATION_TEXT}}</text>\n<date>{{CONTINUATION_DATE}}</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create {{NUM_ALTERNATIVES}} contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre {{GENRE}}. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

The transfer fee is reported to be in the range of \u20ac200,000 to \u20ac300,000, with potential bonuses tied to {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s performance milestones. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}, who averaged 12.5 points per game in {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s developmental league, expressed excitement about the opportunity to compete in {Asia|LOCATION-3}'s fastest-growing basketball market. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s impressive 3-point shooting percentage of 38% and his ability to play both guard positions made him a standout prospect in the Slovenian youth system. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}' General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} stated that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s exceptional ball-handling skills and 6'7\" frame made him an ideal addition to the team's roster. The Lions, currently sitting in fourth place in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} standings, have been seeking a reliable playmaker to complement their strong frontcourt. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director, {David Cimerman|PERSON-3}, confirmed that the transfer includes a buy-back clause after two seasons, allowing the club to monitor {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s development in the Asian league. The buy-back clause is set at \u20ac500,000 and includes performance-based escalators if {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} achieves certain statistical benchmarks in the {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3}. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} praised {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} for creating innovative pathways for young players, citing the transfer as a milestone for the country's basketball development program. The federation has already initiated discussions with other Asian leagues to establish similar development pathways for Slovenian prospects. Korean sports media reported that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} will wear jersey number 7 for {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} and is expected to make his debut against {Busan Thunderbolt|ORGANIZATION-5} in March 2024. The number 7 jersey was previously worn by the team's most popular player, {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4}, who retired last season. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth academy director, {Ana Novak|PERSON-5}, revealed that the club has already identified two more promising prospects for potential future transfers to Asian leagues. Both prospects, aged 16 and 17, are currently participating in a cultural exchange program with a {Japan|LOCATION-4}ese basketball academy to prepare them for potential moves to {Asia|LOCATION-3}. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} announced a special pre-season exhibition game against {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} in {Slovenia|LOCATION-1}, scheduled for September 2024, to celebrate the partnership between the clubs. The exhibition game will be played at the 5,000-seat {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} in {Ljubljana|LOCATION-5}, with tickets expected to sell out within days of release. Korean basketball analysts noted that {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s arrival could help {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} address their need for a skilled playmaker ahead of their {KBL|ORGANIZATION-3} playoff push. {\u017dgur|PERSON-1}'s addition is expected to reduce the workload of veteran point guard {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, who has been averaging 35 minutes per game this season. The transfer marks the first significant player exchange between Slovenian and {Korea|LOCATION-2}n basketball leagues, potentially opening doors for future collaborations between the two national basketball associations.

Veteran basketball player {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} from {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} offered to assist with documentation and preparation for players from his country participating in the program. {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6}, drawing from his experience as a former international player, volunteered to conduct pre-departure orientation sessions and help players compile the required documentation. {David Cimerman|PERSON-3} from VBK \u017daladar announced a revised start date of April 1, 2025, giving teams six additional weeks to complete all necessary documentation. The new timeline included specific deadlines for submitting revised visa applications, medical documentation, and insurance coverage, with weekly progress updates to all participating teams. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} provided additional support by expediting the processing of new visa applications and medical documentation. The federation assigned a dedicated liaison officer to work directly with VBK \u017daladar's {administrative team|ORGANIZATION-1} and coordinate with relevant government agencies to fast-track the documentation process. {European scouting missions|ORGANIZATION-11} confirmed that they would adjust their evaluation schedule to accommodate the new program timeline while maintaining regular monitoring of selected players. The {European scouting missions|ORGANIZATION-11} adjusted their evaluation calendar to include additional assessment periods in April and May 2025, ensuring comprehensive player evaluations despite the delayed start. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} secured additional funding from the {Korean Basketball League|ORGANIZATION-3} to support the rescheduling efforts and documentation process.

You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>The Slovenian Basketball Federation organizes a pre-departure orientation program to help players and their families prepare for the upcoming international exchange program.</text>\n<date>2025-03-15</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create 3 contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre Sports. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

The transfer marks the first significant player exchange between Slovenian and {Korea|LOCATION-2}n basketball leagues, potentially opening doors for future collaborations between the two national basketball associations.

The scouting missions included 12 representatives from the three European leagues, with each league sending four scouts to evaluate potential prospects for their respective youth development programs. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} confirmed that the tournament's group stage will be adjusted from three games per team to five games, allowing scouts more opportunities to evaluate prospects in different match-ups and situations. The revised format will feature morning and afternoon sessions, with games scheduled at 10:00 AM, 12:30 PM, and 3:00 PM to maximize viewing opportunities for the visiting scouts. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} Sporting Director {David Cimerman|PERSON-3} worked with tournament officials to reorganize the schedule, implementing a revised format that features an additional round-robin phase before the knockout stages. The new schedule includes two rest days between the group stage and knockout rounds, allowing teams to recover and adjust their strategies based on their group stage performance. {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} representatives coordinated with local venue management at {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} to extend the tournament's duration from 10 days to 14 days to accommodate the expanded schedule. The extended duration will require additional staffing, with {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} hiring 15 temporary workers to support the increased operational demands of the longer tournament. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth academy director {Ana Novak|PERSON-5} implemented a new rotation system for teams, ensuring each squad receives equal exposure to European scouts while maintaining fair playing time for all participants. The rotation system includes a mandatory 20-minute playing time for each player in the first three games, with subsequent playing time determined by team needs and individual performance. {KBL TV|ORGANIZATION-6} secured additional broadcasting rights to cover the extended tournament, with veteran analyst {Lee Dong-hyun|PERSON-4} joining the commentary team to provide expert insights on potential future prospects.

Tournament ambassador {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1} adjusted his daily clinics schedule to accommodate the new format, now conducting focused sessions on European-style playmaking and defensive techniques. The clinics will be held in two-hour sessions, with 25 players per session, focusing on specific skills such as pick-and-roll execution, perimeter defense, and transition play. {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} veterans {Kim Tae-young|PERSON-6} and {Lee Min-ho|PERSON-7} were assigned to lead additional training sessions, providing hands-on experience to young players seeking to adapt to European basketball styles. The training sessions will emphasize fundamental skills such as ball handling, shooting technique, and defensive positioning, with each session lasting 90 minutes and including both individual and team drills. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} established a dedicated scouting database to track and evaluate player performances across all matches, providing comprehensive data to visiting European scouts. The database will include detailed statistics for each player, including shooting percentages, assist-to-turnover ratios, and defensive metrics, with daily updates available to accredited scouts. European scouting coordinators expressed appreciation for the format adjustment, noting that the expanded schedule would provide more meaningful evaluation opportunities for promising young talents across both {Slovenia|LOCATION-1} and {Korea|LOCATION-2} youth programs. The scouting coordinators specifically praised the addition of morning games, which will allow them to evaluate players in different game situations and against varied competition.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2024-07-21</date><outline>Technical staff at {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1} reported widespread streaming outages during the afternoon session of the {International Youth Basketball Challenge|EVENT-1}, affecting all live broadcasts on {KBL TV|ORGANIZATION-6}. The outages began during the third quarter of the U-16 match between {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth team and {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}'s junior squad, with viewers reporting complete loss of video feed and audio. The streaming issues persisted despite multiple attempts to reset the broadcasting equipment, with {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} technical director stating that fiber optic connectivity problems were the primary cause. The technical team identified a damaged fiber optic cable in the arena's main broadcasting hub, which was causing intermittent signal loss and affecting all four camera feeds simultaneously. {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} Sporting Director {David Cimerman|PERSON-3} announced the cancellation of all evening matches, citing the need to ensure fair viewing conditions for scouts from {European scouting missions|ORGANIZATION-11}. The cancellation affected four matches scheduled for the evening session, including two U-18 quarterfinal games and two U-16 classification matches. Organizers rescheduled four affected matches to the following afternoon, revising the tournament schedule to accommodate additional morning sessions at {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1}. The revised schedule included three morning matches starting at 9:00 AM, with the rescheduled games slotted into the afternoon session to minimize disruption to the tournament's knockout phase. {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2}, General Manager of {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}, arranged for temporary satellite uplink equipment to be installed overnight to prevent future streaming interruptions. The satellite equipment, provided by a local broadcasting partner, included redundant transmission systems and backup power supplies to ensure uninterrupted coverage of the remaining tournament games. {Klemen \u017dgur|PERSON-1}, the tournament ambassador, conducted an impromptu training session for participating youth players during the unexpected downtime, focusing on shooting drills and defensive techniques.

The reorganization included adjusting practice schedules and implementing additional recovery sessions, with teams given at least 24 hours between matches to prevent fatigue. The {Slovenian Basketball Federation|ORGANIZATION-4} issued a statement apologizing for the technical difficulties and assured that all scouts would receive complete video recordings of the affected matches. The federation promised to deliver high-definition recordings of all affected games to the scouting missions within 48 hours, including detailed statistical analysis and player performance metrics. Maintenance crews performed emergency upgrades to {Arena Sto\u017eice|BUILDING-1}'s internet infrastructure, installing redundant connections to prevent similar issues in the tournament's remaining days. The upgrades included the installation of a secondary fiber optic line and a new network switch, with technicians working through the night to complete the necessary modifications. {KBL TV|ORGANIZATION-6} confirmed that their production team would provide expanded coverage of the rescheduled matches, including additional camera angles and enhanced commentary for both Korean and European audiences. The expanded coverage would feature a fifth camera angle focusing on player reactions and bench interactions, along with real-time statistics and player tracking data displayed on screen.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2024-07-28</date><outline>The European scouting missions {European scouting missions|ORGANIZATION-11} submitted their comprehensive final report on the International Youth Basketball Challenge {International Youth Basketball Challenge|EVENT-1}, identifying two Slovenian prospects for immediate recruitment to top-tier European leagues. The report, which spanned 45 pages, included detailed statistical analysis of each prospect's performance across all tournament games, with particular emphasis on their shooting percentages, defensive metrics, and decision-making in high-pressure situations. VBK \u017daladar {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth academy director Ana Novak {Ana Novak|PERSON-5} emphasized the importance of the report, stating \"We're delighted that our players have caught the attention of European scouts, validating our development approach.\" Novak {Ana Novak|PERSON-5} further explained that the report's detailed feedback would be incorporated into VBK \u017daladar {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth development curriculum, with specific focus on areas identified for improvement by the European scouts. The two highlighted prospects, identified as Matic Kova\u010d {Matic Kova\u010d|PERSON-8} and Tim Kova\u010di\u010d {Tim Kova\u010di\u010d|PERSON-9}, were praised for their exceptional shooting range and defensive versatility during the tournament games. Matic Kova\u010d {Matic Kova\u010d|PERSON-8}, a 6'4\" shooting guard, demonstrated a 42% three-point shooting percentage during the tournament, while Tim Kova\u010di\u010d {Tim Kova\u010di\u010d|PERSON-9}, a 6'6\" small forward, averaged 2.5 steals per game and showed remarkable ability to guard multiple positions. The scouting report also recommended long-term monitoring of three additional Slovenian players, noting their significant potential despite needing further development. The three players, aged 15-16, were specifically noted for their physical attributes and raw talent, with the report suggesting they would benefit from another year of development in VBK \u017daladar {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s youth system before being considered for European opportunities. Seoul Metro Lions {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2}' General Manager Park Min-ho {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} expressed satisfaction with the tournament's outcome, confirming plans to collaborate with European leagues on future youth development initiatives. Park Min-ho {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} announced that Seoul Metro Lions {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} would host a joint coaching clinic with European league representatives in September 2024, focusing on sharing best practices in youth development and talent identification.

The tracking system, developed in partnership with VBK \u017daladar {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}, will include quarterly performance evaluations, regular video analysis, and standardized fitness testing to ensure consistent monitoring of the prospects' development. The ACB League {ACB League|ORGANIZATION-8}, Bundesliga {Bundesliga|ORGANIZATION-9}, and Serie A {Serie A|ORGANIZATION-10} jointly announced a plan to host a summer basketball camp in 2025, specifically inviting the two recommended prospects to develop their skills under European coaching. The camp, scheduled for July 2025 in Barcelona {Barcelona|LOCATION-12}, will feature a 10-day intensive training program with daily sessions led by coaches from top European clubs, including specialized workshops on European playing styles and defensive systems. VBK \u017daladar {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1}'s Sporting Director David Cimerman {David Cimerman|PERSON-3} confirmed that the club would maintain regular communication with European scouts, providing updates on the progress of the tracked players. Cimerman {David Cimerman|PERSON-3} outlined a communication schedule that includes monthly progress reports, quarterly video analysis, and bi-annual in-person evaluations with European scouts to ensure transparent monitoring of the players' development. The successful identification of prospects was attributed to the modified tournament format, which provided additional evaluation opportunities for scouts from European leagues. The modified format, which included five games per team instead of the original three, allowed scouts to evaluate players in different game situations and against varied competition, resulting in more comprehensive assessments.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2024-09-30</date><outline>Seoul Metro Lions {Seoul Metro Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} General Manager {Park Min-ho|PERSON-2} and VBK \u017daladar {VBK \u017daladar|ORGANIZATION-1} Sporting Director {David Cimerman|PERSON-3} convened with representatives from ACB League {ACB League|ORGANIZATION-8}, Bundesliga {Bundesliga|ORGANIZATION-9}, and Serie A {Serie A|ORGANIZATION-10} to formalize a one-year trial agreement for youth player exchange programs.
