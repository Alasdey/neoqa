Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. Your task is to create {{NUMBER_SUMMARIES}} new summaries that describe future fictional events following the last event from the <history>. These new summaries should be consistent with the existing story and represent plausible continuations or developments of the original narrative.\n\n4. For each summary, create:\n   a. A summary text (a single concise sentence)\n   b. The date on which this fictional next event happens\n\n5. Before starting, check if the history of events indicates specific dates for followup events. Ensure your continuations are consistent with these expected followup events. All your summaries must either concern this event, or happen before this event.\n\n6. Make sure that each summary you generate focuses on at least one of the main named entities from the history of events.\n\n7. Follow these guidelines when creating your summaries:\n   a. Ensure all summaries are fictional and not based on real events or real people.\n   b. Make the summaries sound realistic and plausible as follow-up stories to the previous outlines. \n   c. Think about plausible next events based on the fictional named entities, the history of the past fictional events and the genre {{GENRE}}. \n   d.

Think about how stories in the {{GENRE}} genre progress in the real-world, NOT in a novel. Provide various realistic alternatives for how the story may progress in either direction.\n- between different key named entities of the fictional story.\n\n8. Output format:\n   - Enclose each summary in <summary> tags.\n   - Each summary must have two child properties:\n     <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n     <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n   - Before each summary, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags.

Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n10.

Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event summaries while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative.\n\nHere's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[This includes the thought process for all summaries.]\n</thought_process>\n\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[Your first summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the first summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n<summary>\n<text>[Your second summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the second summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n[... continue for all summaries ...]\n</summaries>\n</results>",

The renovation preserved the arena's Art Deco design, including its iconic marquee and terrazzo flooring, while integrating modern elements like retractable roofs and energy-efficient HVAC systems. The renovation project of the {Grand Sports Arena|BUILDING-1} was led by noted architect {Felicity Harmond|PERSON-1}, known for blending historical preservation with modern designs. {Felicity Harmond|PERSON-1} collaborated with local historians to ensure that the renovation respected the arena's cultural significance while meeting contemporary standards. The {Grand Sports Arena|BUILDING-1} now boasts state-of-the-art seating that provides a 360-degree view of the playing field, accommodating approximately 12,000 spectators. The new seating arrangement includes ergonomic seats with built-in cup holders and USB charging ports, enhancing the overall spectator experience. Local government officials, including {Mayor Elizabeth Tran|PERSON-2}, praised the renovation, remarking that it positions {Lakelore City|LOCATION-1} as a regional hub for sporting events and cultural gatherings. {Mayor Elizabeth Tran|PERSON-2} emphasized that the arena's reopening would attract major sports leagues and cultural festivals, boosting tourism and local business revenue. The newly installed LED lighting system and high-definition video displays enhance the spectator experience, particularly during evening events or concerts held at the arena. The LED lighting system is designed to reduce energy consumption by 30% and includes customizable color schemes for different events. {Lakelore City|LOCATION-1}\u2019s Sports Committee organized a series of celebratory events to mark the reopening of the {Grand Sports Arena|BUILDING-1}, starting with a friendly {football match|EVENT-1} between local teams, the {Lakelore Lions|ORGANIZATION-2} and the {Valley Eagles|ORGANIZATION-3}. The {football match|EVENT-1} featured a halftime show by the {Lakelore City High School|ORGANIZATION-4} marching band, celebrating local talent and community spirit. Renovation project financing was a joint effort between public funds from the city and private investments from local businesses such as {Horizon Holdings|ORGANIZATION-1}, demonstrating a strong community involvement. The project received a $5 million grant from the state government, which was matched by $3 million in private investments, highlighting the collaborative effort. Chef Jacob L\u00e9on conducted a high-profile catering event during the opening ceremonies, offering gourmet dishes and locally-sourced refreshments to attendees. Chef Jacob L\u00e9on's menu included a signature dish, \"{Lakelore Lamb|PRODUCT-1},\" which featured locally-raised lamb and seasonal vegetables, showcasing regional cuisine. Sales for the inaugural events at the {Grand Sports Arena|BUILDING-1} exceeded expectations, indicating strong public interest and support for the venue\u2019s future use. Box office sales for the opening weekend reached $200,000, surpassing initial projections by 25%, reflecting the community's enthusiasm. {Journalist Amber Norton|PERSON-3} from the {Lakelore Gazette|ORGANIZATION-5} reported positively on the renovations, highlighting the improved accessibility features, including ramps and elevators for individuals with disabilities. {Amber Norton|PERSON-3} noted that the arena now includes tactile paving for visually impaired guests and hearing loops for those with hearing impairments, ensuring inclusivity.</outline></event>",
