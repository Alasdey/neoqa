The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d.
