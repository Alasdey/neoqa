DO NOT say that any of the entities or properties are fictional. It is important that everything seems realistic!\n- Avoid exaggerating the named entities. They can be ordinary and don\u2019t need to be world-class or state-of-the-art.\n- Ensure the details of the named entities are realistic.

Carefully read the provided outline:\n\nDate: 2023-11-14\n<outline>\nThe {Greenfield Falcons|ORGANIZATION-1}, a major European rugby club, announced the departure of their entire coaching staff following an underwhelming season, matching the lowest finish in their history.\nThe {Greenfield Falcons|ORGANIZATION-1} had not finished below fifth place in the league since the 2010 season, making this year's performance particularly disappointing for the club's loyal fan base.\nOn November 14, 2023, {Greenfield Falcons|ORGANIZATION-1}'s management confirmed the recruitment of {Nova Shield FC|ORGANIZATION-2}\u2019s coaching team, known for their innovative defensive strategies, appealing to the club\u2019s desire for a systematic shift in performance.\n{Nova Shield FC|ORGANIZATION-2} had previously led their team to a top-three finish in the {European Rugby League|EVENT-2}, largely due to their emphasis on a robust defensive lineup.\nLead coach {Samuel Blackwood|PERSON-1}, heralded for his tactical acumen, along with defensive analyst {Isabelle Ngo|PERSON-2}, and assistant coach {Eliot Carver|PERSON-3}, would head the new coaching staff.\n{Samuel Blackwood|PERSON-1} had previously coached the national team of a neighboring country, where he implemented a defensive strategy that reduced the average points conceded per game by 30%.\n{Isabelle Ngo|PERSON-2}, known for her analytical prowess, had developed a proprietary software tool that helped {Nova Shield FC|ORGANIZATION-2} analyze opponent weaknesses in real-time.\nThe announcement was made at the club's headquarters, {Renaissance Stadium|BUILDING-1}, the former home of the {Falcons|ORGANIZATION-1}\u2019s long-time supporters.\n{Renaissance Stadium|BUILDING-1}, with a seating capacity of 25,000, has been the site of numerous historic victories for the {Greenfield Falcons|ORGANIZATION-1}, including their last championship win in 2015.\n{Greenfield Falcons|ORGANIZATION-1} President {Helena Marquez|PERSON-4} expressed optimism, stating, \"Our club is poised for a renaissance, ushering in a new era focused on strong defensive play and resilience.\"\nPresident {Helena Marquez|PERSON-4} emphasized that the new coaching staff's approach would be integrated with the club's youth academy to ensure long-term success.\nPlayer representatives from the {Greenfield Falcons|ORGANIZATION-1} expressed mixed reactions, with veteran forward {Dimitri Petrov|PERSON-5} emphasizing the need for \u201cfresh perspectives\u201d but highlighting concerns about adapting to new training routines and methodologies.\n{Dimitri Petrov|PERSON-5}, who has been with the {Greenfield Falcons|ORGANIZATION-1} for over a decade, expressed hope that the new strategies would rejuvenate the team's performance in the upcoming {European Rugby Championship|EVENT-1}.\nAnalysts predict that the new coaching staff\u2019s approach may require a more rigorous training regimen, with a greater emphasis on defensive drills and tactical formations, potentially reshaping team dynamics.\nThe new training regimen is expected to include twice-weekly sessions focused solely on defensive positioning and counter-attack strategies.\nDedicated supporter group {Falcons United|ORGANIZATION-3} organized a meeting to discuss the club\u2019s trajectory, noting that improved defense could lead to better results in the {European Rugby Championship|EVENT-1}.\n{Falcons United|ORGANIZATION-3}, comprising over 5,000 members, has been instrumental in organizing fan events and supporting the club through its challenging seasons.\nThe official unveiling of the new coaching staff was scheduled for November 18, 2023, with a press conference held to outline the {Greenfield Falcons|ORGANIZATION-1}\u2019s strategic goals for the upcoming season.\nDuring the press conference, the new coaching staff outlined a three-year plan aimed at achieving a top-two finish in the league and qualifying for the {European Rugby Champions Cup|EVENT-3}.\nIn anticipation of the new season, ticket sales for home matches saw a moderate increase, signaling growing optimism among the fan base for the {Greenfield Falcons|ORGANIZATION-1}\u2019s next steps under the new leadership.\nThe increase in ticket sales was particularly notable among younger fans, who were attracted by the club's renewed focus on innovation and youth development.\n</outline>\n\nBased on the information provided, create detailed descriptions for each new entity following these guidelines:\n\nGeneral instructions:\n- Ensure all
