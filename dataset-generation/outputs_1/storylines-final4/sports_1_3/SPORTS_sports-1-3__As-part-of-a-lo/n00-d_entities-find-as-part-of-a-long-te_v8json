  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying new named entities from a given outline of a fictional event description. Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<OUTLINE>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures. Note that these lists may be empty or contain partial information:\n\n<entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</entities>\n\nThe definitions with examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural landmarks, and regions.\nExamples: Paris, Mount Everest, California, Amazon Rainforest, Japan, Australia, Australian\n\n- Product\nDefinition: Goods or services created for consumer use or commercial purposes.\nExamples: iPhone, Coca-Cola, Microsoft Office, Tesla Model 3\n\n- Art\nDefinition: Creative works in various forms, including artifacts, ornaments, visual arts, literature, music, and performance.\nExamples: Mona Lisa, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Hamilton (musical)\n\n - Building\nDefinition: Structures designed for human occupancy or use, including residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity. However, this phrase contains the named entity Chicago (location)\n\nExample: \"I bought tickets to go on the Sky Needle, the highest skyscraper in town!\"\n- \"Sky Needle\" is a named entity (building)\n\nExample: \"Aboriginal people from a well known Australian city.\"\n- \"Aboriginal\" is a named entity (Organization)\n- \"Australia\" is a named entity (Location)\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: 2026-03-18\n<OUTLINE>\nOn 2026-03-18, general manager Sera Koldane of Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club announced that Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club had agreed to trade captain Jalen Morvek to Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association.\nThe announcement was delivered at a mid-morning press conference in the media room at Harborline Grounds, with local sports networks and several regional newspapers in attendance.\nGeneral manager Sera Koldane, who is in the second year of a four-year contract, opened the remarks by acknowledging that trading captain Jalen Morvek would be an unpopular move with many longtime supporters of Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club.\nSera Koldane stated that Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club would receive young fly-half Orrin Telvak and young lock Mika Davren from Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association as part of the trade involving Jalen Morvek.\nOrrin Telvak, 22, made eight appearances off the bench for Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association last season, while 21-year-old Mika Davren featured primarily for the club\u2019s development side in the provincial competition.\nBoth Orrin Telvak and Mika Davren are under contract through the 2028 season, giving Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club cost-controlled depth at key positions.\nSera Koldane added that Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club would also acquire a second-round and a fourth-round selection in the 2027 Northern Estrel Rugby League entry draft from Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association.\nAccording to general manager Sera Koldane, the second-round pick currently projects to fall in the middle of the round based on Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association\u2019s recent finishes in the Northern Estrel Rugby League standings.\nNorthern Estrel Rugby League records show that the draft selections conveyed to Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club are unconditional and will transfer regardless of Jalen Morvek\u2019s performance or health.\nHead coach Darin Phelis of Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club explained that the trade of Jalen Morvek to Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association was motivated by a long-term rebuilding strategy for Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club.\nHead coach Darin Phelis referenced the club\u2019s 9\u201315 record in the previous Northern Estrel Rugby League campaign and an aging forward pack as key factors behind the decision.\nDarin Phelis emphasized that the coaching staff and front office had been discussing a potential reset of the roster for more than a year, including scenarios that involved moving high-salary veterans such as Jalen Morvek.\nHead coach Darin Phelis of Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club noted that Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club planned to give expanded playing time to Orrin Telvak and Mika Davren in upcoming Northern Estrel Rugby League preseason fixtures.\nDarin Phelis indicated that Orrin Telvak would be given opportunities to run the attack in at least two of the first three preseason fixtures, including the opener against coastal rival Vessan Tides Rugby Club.\nFor lock Mika Davren, Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club plans to test his lineout calling and maul defense in extended second-half stints as the coaching staff evaluates whether he can handle starting responsibilities by midseason.\nDeparting captain Jalen Morvek issued a prepared statement thanking supporters of Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club and acknowledging the opportunity presented by Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association.\nIn the prepared statement distributed by the club\u2019s media department, Jalen Morvek recalled making his debut for Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club as a teenager and mentioned the atmosphere of night matches at Harborline Grounds as a career highlight.\nThe statement was emailed to season-ticket holders and posted on Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club\u2019s official website shortly after the press conference concluded.\nIn a later interview, Jalen Morvek said that Jalen Morvek believed joining Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association would allow Jalen Morvek to compete for a championship while Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club focused on development.\nSpeaking to a local radio program in the evening, Jalen Morvek noted that Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association had reached the Northern Estrel Rugby League semifinals in two of the past three seasons and said he felt the squad was \u201con the verge\u201d of a title run.\nJalen Morvek, who turned 32 in January, added that he saw the next two to three seasons as his best remaining window to play a leading role on a championship-contending side.\nNewly acquired player Orrin Telvak described the move to Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club as an unexpected chance for Orrin Telvak to secure a starting role under head coach Darin Phelis in the Northern Estrel Rugby League.\nOrrin Telvak acknowledged that at Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association he had been stuck behind established fly-half Ren Varoden on the depth chart and rarely trained with the starting backline unit.\nDescribing his playing style, Orrin Telvak said he prides himself on tactical kicking and calm game management, qualities he believes fit the structured systems favored by head coach Darin Phelis.\nRudek Soundstorm Rugby Club reported that Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club experienced a short-term decline in season ticket renewals at Harborline Grounds following the announcement of the trade of Jalen Morvek.\nClub officials reported that season ticket renewals for Harborline Grounds fell approximately 12 percent compared with the same date the previous year in the 48 hours after news of the trade broke.\nRudek Soundstorm Rugby Club\u2019s ticket office staff fielded numerous calls from frustrated supporters seeking clarification on the organization\u2019s direction and the status of other veteran players.\nNorthern Estrel Rugby League officials confirmed that the trade between Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club and Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association met league regulations and was officially processed on 2026-03-18, making Jalen Morvek eligible to report to Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association immediately.\nNorthern Estrel Rugby League released a brief notice on its official website summarizing the terms of the agreement and listing the updated rosters for both Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club and Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association.\nLeague administrators verified that all financial components, including Jalen Morvek\u2019s remaining salary obligations and registration fees, had been properly reassigned before finalizing the transaction on the central player movement registry.\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the
