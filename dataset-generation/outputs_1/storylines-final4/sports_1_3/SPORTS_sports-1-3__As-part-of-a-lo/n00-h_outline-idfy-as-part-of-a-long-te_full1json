announced that Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club had agreed to trade captain Jalen Morvek to Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association.\nThe announcement was delivered at a mid-morning press conference in the media room at Harborline Grounds, with local sports networks and several regional newspapers in attendance.\nGeneral manager Sera Koldane, who is in the second year of a four-year contract, opened the remarks by acknowledging that trading captain Jalen Morvek would be an unpopular move with many longtime supporters of Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club.\nSera Koldane stated that Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club would receive young fly-half Orrin Telvak and young lock Mika Davren from Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association as part of the trade involving Jalen Morvek.\nOrrin Telvak, 22, made eight appearances off the bench for Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association last season, while 21-year-old Mika Davren featured primarily for the club\u2019s development side in the provincial competition.\nBoth Orrin Telvak and Mika Davren are under contract through the 2028 season, giving Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club cost-controlled depth at key positions.\nSera Koldane added that Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club would also acquire a second-round and a fourth-round selection in the 2027 Northern Estrel Rugby League entry draft from Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association.\nAccording to general manager Sera Koldane, the second-round pick currently projects to fall in the middle of the round based on Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association\u2019s recent finishes in the Northern Estrel Rugby League standings.\nNorthern Estrel Rugby League records show that the draft selections conveyed to Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club are unconditional and will transfer regardless of Jalen Morvek\u2019s performance or health.\nHead coach Darin Phelis of Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club explained that the trade of Jalen Morvek to Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association was motivated by a long-term rebuilding strategy for Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club.\nHead coach Darin Phelis referenced the club\u2019s 9\u201315 record in the previous Northern Estrel Rugby League campaign and an aging forward pack as key factors behind the decision.\nDarin Phelis emphasized that the coaching staff and front office had been discussing a potential reset of the roster for more than a year, including scenarios that involved moving high-salary veterans such as Jalen Morvek.\nHead coach Darin Phelis of Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club noted that Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club planned to give expanded playing time to Orrin Telvak and Mika Davren in upcoming Northern Estrel Rugby League preseason fixtures.\nDarin Phelis indicated that Orrin Telvak would be given opportunities to run the attack in at least two of the first three preseason fixtures, including the opener against coastal rival Vessan Tides Rugby Club.\nFor lock Mika Davren, Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club plans to test his lineout calling and maul defense in extended second-half stints as the coaching staff evaluates whether he can handle starting responsibilities by midseason.\nDeparting captain Jalen Morvek issued a prepared statement thanking supporters of Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club and acknowledging the opportunity presented by Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association.\nIn the prepared statement distributed by the club\u2019s media department, Jalen Morvek recalled making his debut for Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club as a teenager and mentioned the atmosphere of night matches at Harborline Grounds as a career highlight.\nThe statement was emailed to season-ticket holders and posted on Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club\u2019s official website shortly after the press conference concluded.\nIn a later interview, Jalen Morvek said that Jalen Morvek believed joining Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association would allow Jalen Morvek to compete for a championship while Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club focused on development.\nSpeaking to a local radio program in the evening, Jalen Morvek noted that Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association had reached the Northern Estrel Rugby League semifinals in two of the past three seasons and said he felt the squad was \u201con the verge\u201d of a title run.\nJalen Morvek, who turned 32 in January, added that he saw the next two to three seasons as his best remaining window to play a leading role on a championship-contending side.\nNewly acquired player Orrin Telvak described the move to Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club as an unexpected chance for Orrin Telvak to secure a starting role under head coach Darin Phelis in the Northern Estrel Rugby League.\nOrrin Telvak acknowledged that at Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association he had been stuck behind established fly-half Ren Varoden on the depth chart and rarely trained with the starting backline unit.\nDescribing his playing style, Orrin Telvak said he prides himself on tactical kicking and calm game management, qualities he believes fit the structured systems favored by head coach Darin Phelis.\nRudek Soundstorm Rugby Club reported that Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club experienced a short-term decline in season ticket renewals at Harborline Grounds following the announcement of the trade of Jalen Morvek.\nClub officials reported that season ticket renewals for Harborline Grounds fell approximately 12 percent compared with the same date the previous year in the 48 hours after news of the trade broke.\nRudek Soundstorm Rugby Club\u2019s ticket office staff fielded numerous calls from frustrated supporters seeking clarification on the organization\u2019s direction and the status of other veteran players.\nNorthern Estrel Rugby League officials confirmed that the trade between Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club and Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association met league regulations and was officially processed on 2026-03-18, making Jalen Morvek eligible to report to Helvaris Ironmark Rugby Association immediately.\nNorthern Estrel Rugby League released a brief notice on its official website summarizing the terms of the agreement and listing the updated rosters for both Rudek Soundstorm Rugby Club
