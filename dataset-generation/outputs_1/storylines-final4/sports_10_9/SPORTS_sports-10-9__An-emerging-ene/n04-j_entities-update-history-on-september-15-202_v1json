The symposium's agenda included lectures on the importance of balancing academics and athletics, with key insights from educational psychologist {Dr. Evelyn Grant|PERSON-4}. {Dr. Evelyn Grant|PERSON-4}'s lectures covered topics such as cognitive development in student athletes and the role of mental health in academic performance. {Dr. Evelyn Grant|PERSON-4} emphasized the benefits of integrated learning models, proposing innovative curriculum enhancements to better equip students for both academic and sporting excellence. She proposed a curriculum that includes modules on time management, stress reduction techniques, and interdisciplinary projects combining science and sports. Head of {Westfield High School|LOCATION-2}, {Principal Sarah Langley|PERSON-5}, expressed that the symposium's aim was to strengthen academic resources by drawing parallels between educational strategies and athletic training methodologies. {Principal Langley|PERSON-5} highlighted methodologies such as goal-setting techniques used in sports and their application in academic planning.
