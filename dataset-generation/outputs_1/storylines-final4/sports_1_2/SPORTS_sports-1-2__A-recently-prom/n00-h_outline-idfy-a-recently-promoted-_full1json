Eastgate Timberwolves to acquire the experienced pitcher Liam Calderon.\nThe announcement was made at 10:30\u202fa.m. in the Hawks\u2019 press conference room at Riverton Harbor Stadium, following a three\u2011hour negotiation between the two clubs.\nLiam Calderon, who previously spent the 2024 season with the Westbrook Cyclones, posted a 3.78 ERA and 152 strikeouts over 180 innings.\nThe trade sent minor\u2011league prospects Jaxon Vale, Eli Navarro, and Tara Keene from the Riverton Harbor Hawks organization to the Eastgate Timberwolves organization.\nJaxon Vale, a right\u2011handed pitcher, recorded a 2.95 ERA with 78 strikeouts in 95 innings for the Hawks\u2019 Double\u2011A affiliate.\nEli Navarro, a shortstop, hit .285 with 12 doubles and 5 stolen bases in 68 games, while outfielder Tara Keene tallied 12 runs and a .340 on\u2011base percentage at the same level.\nThe trade agreement also transferred the Riverton Harbor Hawks' 2026 first\u2011round draft pick to the Eastgate Timberwolves.\nThe pick is projected to be the 22nd overall selection in the 2026 draft, which Eastgate intends to use on a high\u2011school left\u2011handed pitcher.\nRiverton had previously included a 2025 second\u2011round pick in a separate deal with the Lakeside Lions, further bolstering Eastgate\u2019s draft capital.\nRiverton Harbor Hawks general manager Mara Lydon stated that the acquisition of Liam Calderon aims to strengthen Riverton Harbor Hawks' starting rotation.\nMara Lydon added, \u201cCalderon\u2019s veteran poise and ability to eat innings will give our young arms the confidence they need to develop.\u201d\nShe also noted that the Hawks entered the offseason with a team ERA of 4.12, ranking seventh in the league.\nEastgate Timberwolves general manager Victor Haines confirmed that the received prospects will be placed in Eastgate Timberwolves' Triple\u2011A affiliate.\nVictor Haines specified that Jaxon Vale, Eli Navarro, and Tara Keene will report to the Timberwolves\u2019 Triple\u2011A club in Cedar Falls on April 20.\nTriple\u2011A manager Carlos Mendes said the trio will wear jersey numbers 45, 27, and 33 respectively and will begin training immediately.\nRiverton Harbor Hawks head coach Dylan Ortega announced that Liam Calderon will begin the season in the fifth spot of Riverton Harbor Hawks' rotation.\nDylan Ortega explained that Calderon will make his first start on May\u202f3 against the Harbor City Mariners, serving as a spot starter on Opening Day.\nOrtega also indicated that the Hawks plan to shift to a six\u2011man rotation by mid\u2011June, moving Calderon into the fourth slot.\nLiam Calderon signed a two\u2011year contract extension with the Riverton Harbor Hawks valued at $12\u202fmillion.\nThe extension includes a club option for a third year at $7\u202fmillion and a $4\u202fmillion signing bonus paid upfront.\nUnder the deal, Calderon will earn $6\u202fmillion per season, making him the highest\u2011paid pitcher on the Hawks\u2019 roster.\nCresthaven National Baseball League recorded the transaction as the most significant trade involving a newly promoted team in the 2025 season.\nLeague commissioner Elena Ortiz highlighted the trade in the weekly bulletin, calling it \u201ca landmark move for a club in its first year after promotion.\u201d\nAccording to league analytics, the trade ranks third overall in total player value for the 2025 season, surpassing the previous record set by the 2023 promotion trade.\nRiverton Harbor Hawks scheduled a press conference for April 14, 2025, where Mara Lydon and Dylan Ortega will discuss Liam Calderon's impact.\nThe conference will be held at the downtown Riverton Harbor Arena and will be streamed live on the team\u2019s official website.\nA 90\u2011second video montage of Calderon\u2019s career highlights will be shown at the start of the event, followed by a 15\u2011minute Q&A session.\nCresthaven Sports Review analyst Priya Menon projected that Liam Calderon's experience could lower Riverton Harbor Hawks' team ERA by 0.45 points in the 2025 season.\nPriya Menon emphasized Calderon\u2019s career strikeout\u2011to\u2011walk ratio of 3.2 as a key factor in the projected improvement.\nHer projection was derived from a regression model that incorporated Calderon\u2019s performance over his last three seasons and the Hawks\u2019 current bullpen ERA of 3.95.\n</outline>\n\n<entities>\n<location><category>location</category><id>LOCATION-1</id><name>Riverton
