Here is the outline you need to analyze:\n<outline>\nOn June 30, 2025, the Techville Basketball Association (TBA) announced a new league regulation requiring all teams to use the \"HoloCourt\" app in official games, starting from the next season.\nThe \"HoloCourt\" app, developed by Celerisoft Inc., provides real-time analytics and strategic insights by overlaying player statistics and game data directly onto the court view.\nCelebrated for its innovation in sports technology, \"HoloCourt\" is now mandatory for enhancing strategic gameplay and real-time analytics during matches in the TBA.\nThe app's integration into games is expected to allow coaches to make data-driven decisions, potentially altering traditional coaching methods.\nHead Coach Emily Rivers of the Techville Titans, while acknowledging the league's decision, emphasized the significance of patience and adaptation to the new regulation by her team.\nEmily Rivers highlighted that the team would need several practice sessions to fully integrate \"HoloCourt\" into their game strategies.\nDanny Harper, Head of Player Development at the Oakfield Owls, expressed mixed feelings about the rule, stating it could elevate game strategies but might disadvantage teams less familiar with tech.\nHarper mentioned that the Oakfield Owls would need to invest in additional training sessions to ensure their players are comfortable with the new technology.\nRookie player Alex Johnson of the Techville Titans shared insights on how \"HoloCourt\" had already positively influenced his training by providing detailed performance analytics.\nAlex Johnson noted that the app helped him identify weaknesses in his shooting technique, allowing him to focus on specific areas during practice.\nKevin Smith, Defensive Coordinator for the Techville Titans, held a meeting with his defensive units to explore how real-time data integration could refine existing defensive strategies.\nSmith discussed incorporating \"HoloCourt\" data to adjust defensive formations dynamically based on opponent tendencies.\nLara Thompson, Assistant Coach of the Techville Titans, collaborated with the software development team at \"Celerisoft Inc.\" to customize the app's features based on player feedback.\nThompson worked on developing a user interface that would allow players to access specific data points quickly during games.\nLocal sports journalist Sam Turner reported that the \"tech-based paradigm shift\" is sparking conversations within the Techville sports community regarding the future of sports analytics.\nTurner's article highlighted interviews with fans and local coaches who expressed both excitement and skepticism about the mandatory use of \"HoloCourt.\"\nThe city's Tech Innovation Hub organized a public seminar where Daniel Black of Celerisoft Inc. discussed the implications of mandatory technological integration in sports.\nDuring the seminar, Daniel Black explained how \"HoloCourt\" could enhance fan engagement by providing interactive viewing experiences.\nThe release of \"HoloCourt 2.0,\" with advanced AI features, was announced by Celerisoft Inc. to support teams in adapting quickly to the TBA's new game-day requirement.\n\"HoloCourt 2.0\" includes predictive analytics that can suggest optimal plays based on real-time game data, aiming to give teams a competitive edge.\n</outline>\n\n3.

Users can choose from a variety of data points, such as player speed, shooting accuracy, and defensive metrics, to tailor the information to their preferences. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} development received support from the {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, which provided grants to promote technological advancements in sports entertainment.
