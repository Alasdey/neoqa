  "instructions": "You are an AI tasked with creating alternative fictional future news summaries based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate summaries of plausible alternative continuations of an existing narrative. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. First, you will be given known entities in this fictional world:\n\n<known_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</known_entities>\n\n2. Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>{{CONTINUATION_TEXT}}</text>\n<date>{{CONTINUATION_DATE}}</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create {{NUM_ALTERNATIVES}} contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre {{GENRE}}. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>The Techville Titans, led by head coach Emily Rivers, adjust their training regimen to gradually integrate HoloCourt insights, aiming for a seamless adaptation period.</text>\n<date>2025-06-01</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create 3 contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Enclose all summaries in <summaries> tags.\n   - For each summary:\n     <summary>\n       <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n       <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n     </summary>\n\n8. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre Sports. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n9. Here's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[Your explanation of the thought process, including identification of known followup events and verification of consistency]\n</thought_process>\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[First alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n<summary>\n<text>[Second alternative summary]</text>\n<date>[Date of the event]</date>\n</summary>\n[Additional summaries as needed]\n</summaries>\n</results>\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event continuations while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative. Begin your response with the <results> tag and end it with the </results> tag.",

    "HISTORY_XML": "<event><date>2025-04-15</date><outline>On April 15, 2025, {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} unveiled an augmented reality app called \"{HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}\" during a press conference at the {Innovator's Hall|BUILDING-1} in the city of {Techville|LOCATION-1}. The {Innovator's Hall|BUILDING-1}, known for hosting cutting-edge technology unveilings, was filled with industry experts and media representatives eager to witness the latest innovation. The app, developed by a talented team led by {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, an augmented reality expert, is designed to enhance home viewers' experience during basketball games by overlaying real-time statistics and player tracking. {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, who holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on augmented reality, has previously worked on several high-profile projects in the tech industry. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} successfully integrates with existing televisions and smart glasses, allowing users to experience dynamic graphics and stats as interactive overlays during live basketball broadcasts. The integration process involves a simple plug-and-play setup, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of television models and popular smart glasses brands. During its public demonstration, competitor basketball enthusiast {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2} provided feedback, noting the seamless integration of player movement tracking and statistical overlays. {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2}, a well-known figure in the basketball community, praised the app for its accuracy in tracking player movements and the clarity of the statistical data presented. The app was praised by sports journalist {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} for its innovative approach to enriching at-home sports viewing, particularly for casual fans who desire a deeper understanding of game dynamics. {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} highlighted that {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s user-friendly interface makes it accessible even to those who are not tech-savvy, enhancing the overall viewing experience. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} also offers customizable features, allowing users to personalize their experience by selecting which statistics and tracking data to display during a game. Users can choose from a variety of data points, such as player speed, shooting accuracy, and defensive metrics, to tailor the information to their preferences. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} development received support from the {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, which provided grants to promote technological advancements in sports entertainment. The {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, established to foster innovation in sports technology, has previously supported projects that enhance fan engagement and athlete performance. Celebrations held at {Techville|LOCATION-1}'s {City Sports Arena|BUILDING-2} saw local basketball teams utilize {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to analyze upcoming opponents, adding a layer of strategic benefit to the app. Teams like the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} and the {Techville Tigers|ORGANIZATION-4} used {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to study opponent strategies and player tendencies, gaining insights that could influence game plans. Despite initial excitement, some critics, like tech analyst {Liam Greene|PERSON-4}, warned that over-reliance on the app might distract viewers from the live action, urging balanced use during broadcasts. {Liam Greene|PERSON-4} suggested that while {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} offers valuable insights, viewers should be mindful not to let the digital overlays overshadow the live game experience. Following the launch, {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} announced an upcoming partnership with local sports bars in {Techville|LOCATION-1} to offer live demo experiences, aiming to broaden the app's user base. The partnership includes a series of promotional events where patrons can try {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} for free, with the goal of increasing its adoption among sports enthusiasts in the community.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-05-10</date><outline>The {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} held their first practice session utilizing {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} at {Techville Sports Complex|BUILDING-3} for analyzing offensive plays. The {Techville Sports Complex|BUILDING-3}, known for its state-of-the-art facilities, provided an ideal environment for integrating advanced technology like {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} into the team's practice routines. During the practice, head coach {Emily Rivers|PERSON-5} noted that while the data from {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} provided new insights, immediate improvements in performance were not evident. {Emily Rivers|PERSON-5}, who has been with the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} for over a decade, emphasized the importance of patience as the team adapts to the new technology. Rookie forward, {Alex Johnson|PERSON-6}, expressed enthusiasm about {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}, highlighting its potential to give players better insights into their gameplay during post-practice reviews. {Alex Johnson|PERSON-6}, known for his agility and quick reflexes, mentioned that the real-time feedback from {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} could help him refine his shooting technique. Defensive coordinator {Kevin Smith|PERSON-7} remained cautious, emphasizing that real game scenarios would be the true test for {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s effectiveness in enhancing plays. {Kevin Smith|PERSON-7}, who has a reputation for his strategic defensive setups, suggested that the team should focus on integrating {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s insights with their existing defensive drills. The drill included the use of {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s real-time statistical feedback to adjust shooting approaches, although the technical setup required some time for players to acclimate. Players had to familiarize themselves with the interface, which involved learning to interpret the overlay data without disrupting their natural gameplay rhythm. Team psychologist {Dr. Emma Fields|PERSON-8} mentioned the mental adjustment required for players to balance reliance on digital tools with their intuitive gameplay strategies. {Dr. Emma Fields|PERSON-8}, who has been working with the team to enhance their mental resilience, highlighted the importance of maintaining focus amidst the influx of digital information. Meanwhile, assistant coach {Lara Thompson|PERSON-9} worked on integrating {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s analytics into the team's existing strategy by combining player-tracking data with live coaching feedback. {Lara Thompson|PERSON-9}, known for her analytical approach to coaching, was developing a hybrid strategy that leveraged both traditional coaching methods and {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s advanced analytics. The city\u2019s local sports journalist, {Sam Turner|PERSON-12}, covered the practice session, focusing on how Techville\u2019s pride local team was embracing technology to evolve. In his article, {Sam Turner|PERSON-12} highlighted the community's excitement about the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3}'s innovative approach and the potential impact on local sports culture. Interspersed in the session were discussions by players about how the overlaid statistics could be used to refine individual practice regimens. Players like point guard {Michael Lee|PERSON-10} discussed how they could use the data to tailor their training sessions, focusing on areas needing improvement. Following the practice, {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} representative, {Daniel Black|PERSON-11}, held a meeting with {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3}'s management to discuss further customizations of {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} based on the team's feedback. {Daniel Black|PERSON-11}, who has been instrumental in the app's development, assured the team that {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} was committed to refining {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to better meet the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3}'s needs.</outline></event>",
