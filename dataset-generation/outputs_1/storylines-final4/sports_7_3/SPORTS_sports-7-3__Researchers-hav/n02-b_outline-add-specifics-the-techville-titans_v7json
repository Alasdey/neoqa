  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a fictional event summary and its corresponding outline to enrich it with additional NEW specific details. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. Read the provided fictional event summary of the genre {{GENRE}}:\n\n<event_summary>\n{{EVENT_SUMMARY}}\n</event_summary>\n\n2. These are the fictional known entities:\n<known_entities>\n<LOCATIONS>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n</LOCATIONS>\n\n<PERSONS>\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n</PERSONS>\n\n<ORGANIZATIONS>\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n</ORGANIZATIONS>\n\n<PRODUCTS>\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n</PRODUCTS>\n\n<ARTS>\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n</ARTS>\n\n<EVENTS>\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n</EVENTS>\n\n<BUILDINGS>\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n</BUILDINGS>\n\n<MISCELLANEOUS>\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</MISCELLANEOUS>\n</known_entities>\n\n3. Review the outline of previous events that have occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n4. Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<outline>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to {{NUM_SPECIFIC_SENTS}} novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre ({{GENRE}}) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre {{GENRE}}. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",

The {Innovator's Hall|BUILDING-1}, known for hosting cutting-edge technology unveilings, was filled with industry experts and media representatives eager to witness the latest innovation. The app, developed by a talented team led by {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, an augmented reality expert, is designed to enhance home viewers' experience during basketball games by overlaying real-time statistics and player tracking. {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, who holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on augmented reality, has previously worked on several high-profile projects in the tech industry. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} successfully integrates with existing televisions and smart glasses, allowing users to experience dynamic graphics and stats as interactive overlays during live basketball broadcasts. The integration process involves a simple plug-and-play setup, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of television models and popular smart glasses brands. During its public demonstration, competitor basketball enthusiast {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2} provided feedback, noting the seamless integration of player movement tracking and statistical overlays. {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2}, a well-known figure in the basketball community, praised the app for its accuracy in tracking player movements and the clarity of the statistical data presented. The app was praised by sports journalist {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} for its innovative approach to enriching at-home sports viewing, particularly for casual fans who desire a deeper understanding of game dynamics. {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} highlighted that {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s user-friendly interface makes it accessible even to those who are not tech-savvy, enhancing the overall viewing experience. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} also offers customizable features, allowing users to personalize their experience by selecting which statistics and tracking data to display during a game. Users can choose from a variety of data points, such as player speed, shooting accuracy, and defensive metrics, to tailor the information to their preferences. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} development received support from the {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, which provided grants to promote technological advancements in sports entertainment. The {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, established to foster innovation in sports technology, has previously supported projects that enhance fan engagement and athlete performance. Celebrations held at {Techville|LOCATION-1}'s {City Sports Arena|BUILDING-2} saw local basketball teams utilize {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to analyze upcoming opponents, adding a layer of strategic benefit to the app. Teams like the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} and the {Techville Tigers|ORGANIZATION-4} used {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to study opponent strategies and player tendencies, gaining insights that could influence game plans.

Following the launch, {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} announced an upcoming partnership with local sports bars in {Techville|LOCATION-1} to offer live demo experiences, aiming to broaden the app's user base. The partnership includes a series of promotional events where patrons can try {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} for free, with the goal of increasing its adoption among sports enthusiasts in the community.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-05-10</date><outline>The {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} held their first practice session utilizing {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} at {Techville Sports Complex|BUILDING-3} for analyzing offensive plays. The {Techville Sports Complex|BUILDING-3}, known for its state-of-the-art facilities, provided an ideal environment for integrating advanced technology like {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} into the team's practice routines. During the practice, head coach {Emily Rivers|PERSON-5} noted that while the data from {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} provided new insights, immediate improvements in performance were not evident. {Emily Rivers|PERSON-5}, who has been with the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} for over a decade, emphasized the importance of patience as the team adapts to the new technology. Rookie forward, {Alex Johnson|PERSON-6}, expressed enthusiasm about {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}, highlighting its potential to give players better insights into their gameplay during post-practice reviews. {Alex Johnson|PERSON-6}, known for his agility and quick reflexes, mentioned that the real-time feedback from {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} could help him refine his shooting technique. Defensive coordinator {Kevin Smith|PERSON-7} remained cautious, emphasizing that real game scenarios would be the true test for {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s effectiveness in enhancing plays. {Kevin Smith|PERSON-7}, who has a reputation for his strategic defensive setups, suggested that the team should focus on integrating {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s insights with their existing defensive drills. The drill included the use of {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s real-time statistical feedback to adjust shooting approaches, although the technical setup required some time for players to acclimate. Players had to familiarize themselves with the interface, which involved learning to interpret the overlay data without disrupting their natural gameplay rhythm. Team psychologist {Dr. Emma Fields|PERSON-8} mentioned the mental adjustment required for players to balance reliance on digital tools with their intuitive gameplay strategies. {Dr. Emma Fields|PERSON-8}, who has been working with the team to enhance their mental resilience, highlighted the importance of maintaining focus amidst the influx of digital information. Meanwhile, assistant coach {Lara Thompson|PERSON-9} worked on integrating {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s analytics into the team's existing strategy by combining player-tracking data with live coaching feedback. {Lara Thompson|PERSON-9}, known for her analytical approach to coaching, was developing a hybrid strategy that leveraged both traditional coaching methods and {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s advanced analytics. The city\u2019s local sports journalist, {Sam Turner|PERSON-12}, covered the practice session, focusing on how Techville\u2019s pride local team was embracing technology to evolve. In his article, {Sam Turner|PERSON-12} highlighted the community's excitement about the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3}'s innovative approach and the potential impact on local sports culture. Interspersed in the session were discussions by players about how the overlaid statistics could be used to refine individual practice regimens. Players like point guard {Michael Lee|PERSON-10} discussed how they could use the data to tailor their training sessions, focusing on areas needing improvement. Following the practice, {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} representative, {Daniel Black|PERSON-11}, held a meeting with {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3}'s management to discuss further customizations of {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} based on the team's feedback. {Daniel Black|PERSON-11}, who has been instrumental in the app's development, assured the team that {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} was committed to refining {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to better meet the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3}'s needs.</outline></event>\n</history>\n\n4. Review the date and outline of the event:\n\nDate: 2025-06-01\n<outline>\nOn June 1, 2025, the Techville Titans held a basketball practice session at Techville Sports Complex, using HoloCourt as part of their training routine.\nHead Coach Emily Rivers reviewed various traditional drills and incorporated minor elements of HoloCourt data, primarily for strategic review sessions post-practice.\nRookie forward Alex Johnson engaged with HoloCourt analytics to review his shooting form and attempted to apply the suggested modifications during drills.\nDefensive Coordinator Kevin Smith observed the practice with a cautious approach, focusing on maintaining the rigor of existing defensive formations.\nAssistant Coach Lara Thompson continued refining the hybrid strategy, balancing HoloCourt's analytics with conventional coaching feedback.\nTeam psychologist Dr. Emma Fields conducted sessions to help players adapt mentally to the integration of technological tools in their training regimen.\nSports journalist Sam Turner visited the practice session to document the limited changes and noted the team's emphasis on traditional techniques.\nDaniel Black of Celerisoft Inc. attended a feedback session with Techville Titans' management, discussing possible future enhancements to HoloCourt based on the team's continued use.\nPoint guard Michael Lee expressed his view that while HoloCourt offers valuable insights, it complements rather than replaces established methods.\nThe practice concluded with emphasis on incremental improvements, demonstrating that integration of HoloCourt would be a gradual process.\n</outline>\n\n5. Your task is to enrich this outline with additional details. The enhanced outline must discuss the same events as before and must not extend the events that happened in the outline. It must only provide supplementary details about these events in the outline.\n\n6. Follow these rules for enrichment:\n   a. Examine each sentence in the provided outline.\n   b. For each sentence, identify information that is unspecific or can be elaborated with more detail.\n   c. Consider the outline to be all information that is provided to a reporter about this fictional event and only include additional specific details that could also be known to the reporter at this point in time:\n      - Some events may still be ongoing and some information may not be available at this point in time.\n      - Do not include information that would likely not be known at this point in time.\n      - Consider the perspective of what is currently known about this fictional event when adding details.\n   d. When you find something unspecific, add a new sentence with supplementary specific details:\n      - Place the new sentence directly after the original sentence in the outline.\n      - Ensure the new sentence does not repeat content from the previous sentence.\n      - Focus solely on providing supplementary specific details in the new sentence.\n      - Make the new sentence self-contained and coherent on its own (do not refer to previously mentioned named entities by pronoun. Instead, directly refer to them via the name).\n   e. For each original sentence generate up to 2 novel sentences that introduce supplementary details.\n\n7. Additional guidelines:\n   - Do not modify the existing sentences. Only add new sentences for supplementary details.\n   - Ensure added sentences focus exclusively on new, specific information without repeating existing content.\n   - Maintain consistency with the original outline in all additional specifics.\n   - Do not introduce new subevents. Only provide more details about the events already mentioned.\n   - Make sure the additional details provided are new and do not reiterate details known from the fictional history or the list of fictional known entities.\n   - Make sure that the new details are not contradictory to the history (<history>) and known entities (<known_entities>).\n   - Do not exaggerate the outline. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the outline and the scope and influence of the event realistic.\n   - Do not create outlines with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful outlines with specific details and events that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n8. Present your enriched outline in the following format:\n   - Make sure that the sentences with the additional specific details are listed as separate <storyitem> and placed at the correct position within the outline.\n   - Treat each new sentence you have created as a separate <storyitem>.\n   - Each sentence provided to you in the outline forms one <storyitem> and must not be changed.\n   - Each new sentence you have written that provides additional specific details forms one <storyitem> and must be listed separately.\n\nImportant:\nBefore you start writing the new sentences with specific details, think about various dimensions that could be extended that align well with the genre, history, provided event summary and existing outline. Think about specific directions that could be of interest within the current genre (Sports) and brainstorm how you could deepen the outline with new specific details on these interesting dimensions. Carefully decide when it is reasonable to provide technical details, when it make more sense to provide quotes, visions, etc., when to provide background information. Think about information that are of interest to a reader of a newspaper with the genre Sports. Be in particular careful before introducing technological details and first examine if these details are appropriate for the genre or not.\nDouble-check that each detail is compatible with all the existing information you are provided with.\n\nUse this structure:\n<scratchpad>[Your thoughts go here.]</scratchpad>\n<results>\n<storyitems>\n<storyitem>[Insert first storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Insert second storyitem here]</storyitem>\n<storyitem>[Continue with additional storyitems as needed]</storyitem>\n</storyitems>\n</results>\n\nMaintain the chronological order and logical flow of the original outline while adding your supplementary details. Each <storyitem> should contain one sentence from the original outline or one new sentence with additional specific details.",

The drill included the use of {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s real-time statistical feedback to adjust shooting approaches, although the technical setup required some time for players to acclimate. Players had to familiarize themselves with the interface, which involved learning to interpret the overlay data without disrupting their natural gameplay rhythm.
