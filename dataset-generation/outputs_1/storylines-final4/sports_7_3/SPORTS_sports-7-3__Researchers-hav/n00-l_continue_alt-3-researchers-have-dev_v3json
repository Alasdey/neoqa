  "instructions": "You are an AI tasked with creating alternative fictional future news summaries based on provided information. \nYour goal is to generate summaries of plausible alternative continuations of an existing narrative. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. First, you will be given known entities in this fictional world:\n\n<known_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</known_entities>\n\n2. Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. You will be given the following plausible summary of how the fictional event evolves:\n<continuation_summary>\n<text>{{CONTINUATION_TEXT}}</text>\n<date>{{CONTINUATION_DATE}}</date>\n</continuation_summary>\n\n4. Your task is to create {{NUM_ALTERNATIVES}} contradictory alternative summaries of how the fictional event can progress based on the provided continuation summary. \nEach of these continuation summaries must make subtle changes to the continuation summary such that they are contradictory alternatives to one another.\nThis means, if the story evolves with one of the continuation summaries, the other ones cannot happen anymore.\n\n5. When changing the provided continuation summary, maintain these key properties:\n   a) The central topic and involved main entity\n   b) The stance (whether this is a positive, neutral or negative story evolvement)\n   c) The impact (whether this is a high impact, medium impact or low impact evolvement)\n   d) The same date\n\n6. Guidelines for creating alternative summaries:\n   - Ensure each new continuation summary is consistent with the existing story and represents a plausible continuation or development of the original narrative.\n   - Write each continuation summary as a single concise sentence in an objective tone.\n   - Make sure your continuations are consistent with any known followup events regarding the date.\n\n7. Output format:\n   - Enclose your entire response in <results> tags.\n   - Before the summaries, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags.

Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - When brainstorming alternative event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre {{GENRE}}. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid making summaries \"groundbreaking.\" Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n9.

The {Innovator's Hall|BUILDING-1}, known for hosting cutting-edge technology unveilings, was filled with industry experts and media representatives eager to witness the latest innovation. The app, developed by a talented team led by {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, an augmented reality expert, is designed to enhance home viewers' experience during basketball games by overlaying real-time statistics and player tracking. {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, who holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on augmented reality, has previously worked on several high-profile projects in the tech industry. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} successfully integrates with existing televisions and smart glasses, allowing users to experience dynamic graphics and stats as interactive overlays during live basketball broadcasts. The integration process involves a simple plug-and-play setup, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of television models and popular smart glasses brands. During its public demonstration, competitor basketball enthusiast {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2} provided feedback, noting the seamless integration of player movement tracking and statistical overlays. {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2}, a well-known figure in the basketball community, praised the app for its accuracy in tracking player movements and the clarity of the statistical data presented. The app was praised by sports journalist {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} for its innovative approach to enriching at-home sports viewing, particularly for casual fans who desire a deeper understanding of game dynamics. {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} highlighted that {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s user-friendly interface makes it accessible even to those who are not tech-savvy, enhancing the overall viewing experience. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} also offers customizable features, allowing users to personalize their experience by selecting which statistics and tracking data to display during a game. Users can choose from a variety of data points, such as player speed, shooting accuracy, and defensive metrics, to tailor the information to their preferences. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} development received support from the {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, which provided grants to promote technological advancements in sports entertainment. The {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, established to foster innovation in sports technology, has previously supported projects that enhance fan engagement and athlete performance. Celebrations held at {Techville|LOCATION-1}'s {City Sports Arena|BUILDING-2} saw local basketball teams utilize {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to analyze upcoming opponents, adding a layer of strategic benefit to the app. Teams like the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} and the {Techville Tigers|ORGANIZATION-4} used {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to study opponent strategies and player tendencies, gaining insights that could influence game plans. Despite initial excitement, some critics, like tech analyst {Liam Greene|PERSON-4}, warned that over-reliance on the app might distract viewers from the live action, urging balanced use during broadcasts. {Liam Greene|PERSON-4} suggested that while {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} offers valuable insights, viewers should be mindful not to let the digital overlays overshadow the live game experience. Following the launch, {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} announced an upcoming partnership with local sports bars in {Techville|LOCATION-1} to offer live demo experiences, aiming to broaden the app's user base. The partnership includes a series of promotional events where patrons can try {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} for free, with the goal of increasing its adoption among sports enthusiasts in the community.</outline></event>\n</history>\n\n3.
