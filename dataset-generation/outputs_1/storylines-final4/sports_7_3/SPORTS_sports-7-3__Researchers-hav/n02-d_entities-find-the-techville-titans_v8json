  "instructions": "You are an AI assistant tasked with identifying new named entities from a given outline of a fictional event description. Your goal is to identify any new named entities mentioned in the OUTLINE that are not already present in the provided lists of existing entities.\n\nFirst, carefully read and analyze the following OUTLINE:\n\nDate: {{DATE}}\n<OUTLINE>\n{{OUTLINE}}\n</OUTLINE>\n\nNow, review the existing named entities in the following XML structures. Note that these lists may be empty or contain partial information:\n\n<entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</entities>\n\nThe definitions with examples for each named entity category are listed here:\n- Person\nDefinition: Individual human beings, including fictional figures.\nExamples: Barack Obama, William Shakespeare, Harry Potter, Marie Curie\n\n-Organization\nDefinition: Groups of people working together for a common purpose, including companies, institutions, ethnic groups, communities and government bodies.\nExamples: United Nations, Apple Inc., Harvard University, Greenpeace, Maori\n\n- Location\nDefinition: Geographical or political areas, locations, countries (together with their nationalities), cities, natural landmarks, and regions.\nExamples: Paris, Mount Everest, California, Amazon Rainforest, Japan, Australia, Australian\n\n- Product\nDefinition: Goods or services created for consumer use or commercial purposes.\nExamples: iPhone, Coca-Cola, Microsoft Office, Tesla Model 3\n\n- Art\nDefinition: Creative works in various forms, including artifacts, ornaments, visual arts, literature, music, and performance.\nExamples: Mona Lisa, To Kill a Mockingbird, Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Hamilton (musical)\n\n - Building\nDefinition: Structures designed for human occupancy or use, including residential, commercial, and public structures.\nExamples: Empire State Building, Taj Mahal, Sydney Opera House, Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity. However, this phrase contains the named entity Chicago (location)\n\nExample: \"I bought tickets to go on the Sky Needle, the highest skyscraper in town!\"\n- \"Sky Needle\" is a named entity (building)\n\nExample: \"Aboriginal people from a well known Australian city.\"\n- \"Aboriginal\" is a named entity (Organization)\n- \"Australia\" is a named entity (Location)\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

Buckingham Palace\n\n - Event\nDefinition: Significant occurrences or planned gatherings, including historical moments, celebrations, and competitions.\nExamples: World War II, Olympic Games, Woodstock Music Festival, Super Bowl\n\n - Miscellaneous\nDefinition: Other named entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as abstract concepts, unique identifiers.\nExamples: Theory of Relativity, Morse Code, Brexit, Zodiac Signs\n\nIMPORTANT: You must ONLY identify a named entity if the outline explicitly refers to the entity by name.\nDO NOT list entities for events which are not explicitly referred to by name. \nDO NOT list entities for buildings that are not explicitly referred to by name (e.g. a big Chicago villa)\n\nExample: \"On the 27th birthday of Carla Short\"\n- \"Carla Short\" is a named entity (Person)\n- No named event is in this statement\n\nExample: \"On the third day of the Banana Split Festival I left my keys\"\n- National Banana Split Festival is a named entity (Event)\n\nExample: \"I sold my $13M Chicago villa.\"\n- \"Chicago\" is a named entity (Location)\n- \"$13M Chicago villa\" is NOT a named entity. However, this phrase contains the named entity Chicago (location)\n\nExample: \"I bought tickets to go on the Sky Needle, the highest skyscraper in town!\"\n- \"Sky Needle\" is a named entity (building)\n\nExample: \"Aboriginal people from a well known Australian city.\"\n- \"Aboriginal\" is a named entity (Organization)\n- \"Australia\" is a named entity (Location)\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identification of named entities: Carefully read through the OUTLINE and identify all named entities (locations, persons, organizations, products, art, events, buildings, or miscellaneous) that are mentioned by name. Consider all named entities. Carefully follow the definition and examples provided for each entity type above. DO NOT ignore named entities from the outline that exist in the real world. Carefully double-check that you did not miss any named entities. If you are in doubt about some named entities, epxlain why you bare not sure.\n\n2. Remove entities that are already known and only keep new named entities:\n   a. For each named entity you identify, check if it already exists in the <entities>. If <entities> is empty, consider all named entities as new.\n   b. Only keep new named entities which cannot be found in the <entities> list of known named entities.\n   c. Ensure that each new named entity is explicitly mentioned by name in the <outline>. The outline may refer to various entities (such as events, buildings, products) that are described generally but not by a specific name. These should not be identified as named entities.\n\n3. Verification and refinement of new named entities:\n   a. Review your preliminary list of new named entities.\n   b. Double-check each named entity against the existing XML structures to ensure it is truly new and not already present.\n   c. For each new named entity, determine its full name as it appears in the OUTLINE. Do not infer or create additional information.\n   d. Ensure that the full name of each named entity is distinct. Two different entities MUST NOT share the same full name.\n   e. Examine your list of verified new named entities for any redundancies. If any entities refer to the same person, place, organization, product, art piece, event, building, or miscellaneous item but are mentioned with slight variations in the OUTLINE, keep only the most complete or accurate version and remove the others.\n   f. Do not list abbreviations as separate entities. If an abbreviation is used, do not include it with the full name of the entity, and do not create a separate entry for it.\n   g. Ensure that each identified named entity refers to an actual identifiable entity mentioned in the OUTLINE.\n\n4. Formatting and outputting the final list:\n   a. Categorize each verified new named entity as either a location, person, organization, product, art, event, building, or miscellaneous.\n   b. Format your output for each new named entity using the appropriate XML tag based on its category:\n      - For locations: <location>Full Name of Location</location>\n      - For persons: <person>Full Name of Person</person>\n      - For organizations: <organization>Full Name of Organization</organization>\n      - For products: <product>Full Name of Product</product>\n      - For art: <art>Full Name of Art Piece</art>\n      - For events: <event>Full Name of Event</event>\n      - For buildings: <building>Full Name of Building</building>\n      - For miscellaneous: <miscellaneous>Full Name of Miscellaneous Entity</miscellaneous>\n   c. If no new named entities are found after verification and redundancy removal, output <no_new_entities>No new named entities identified</no_new_entities>\n\n5. Double-check miscellaneous\n   a. If you classified any new entity as miscellaneous:\n       - Compare the entity and how it is used in context with all other named entity types\n       - Check if any of the other entity types fits this named entity (it does not need to fit 100%)\n       - If any of these entities seem applicable to the entity, list the named entity with the newly found entity and NOT as miscellaneous entity.\n\nSometimes the difference between the named entities is blurry. To help you make decisions in borderline cases follow these rules:\n- Organization or Building: If in doubt, use \"organization\" instead of \"building\". Only use \"building\" if the name alone clearly identifies the entity as a building.  \n\nImportant notes:\n- All entities in this task should be fictional and should be treated as distinct from any existing real-world or fictional entities. However, you must identify the names exactly as they appear in the OUTLINE, even if they are similar to real-world entities.\n- Remember not to list abbreviations as separate entities. \n- Include the names of any real-world entities from the outline.\n- Only list NAMED entities. Do not create names for all entities that occur within the story.\n- Make sure that you have an output for EACH NEW named entity that you have identified!\n\nUse a <scratchpad> node within the <results> root node for all your reasoning. DO NOT include any XML tags in the reasoning process.\n\nPresent your final list of new named entities in this format:\n\n<output>\n[Your list of new named entities in XML format goes here]\n</output>\n\nIf you need to think through your process or make notes, use UPPERCASE variable names for your thinking process. Your final output should only include the new named entities or the no_new_entities tag if applicable.\n\nList all output including your thinking process within a single <results> node.\n\nBefore finalizing your output, double-check that you did not miss any named entities from the outline and that each named entity has a distinct full name.",

      "<event><date>2025-04-15</date><outline>On April 15, 2025, {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} unveiled an augmented reality app called \"{HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}\" during a press conference at the {Innovator's Hall|BUILDING-1} in the city of {Techville|LOCATION-1}. The {Innovator's Hall|BUILDING-1}, known for hosting cutting-edge technology unveilings, was filled with industry experts and media representatives eager to witness the latest innovation. The app, developed by a talented team led by {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, an augmented reality expert, is designed to enhance home viewers' experience during basketball games by overlaying real-time statistics and player tracking. {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, who holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on augmented reality, has previously worked on several high-profile projects in the tech industry. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} successfully integrates with existing televisions and smart glasses, allowing users to experience dynamic graphics and stats as interactive overlays during live basketball broadcasts. The integration process involves a simple plug-and-play setup, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of television models and popular smart glasses brands. During its public demonstration, competitor basketball enthusiast {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2} provided feedback, noting the seamless integration of player movement tracking and statistical overlays. {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2}, a well-known figure in the basketball community, praised the app for its accuracy in tracking player movements and the clarity of the statistical data presented. The app was praised by sports journalist {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} for its innovative approach to enriching at-home sports viewing, particularly for casual fans who desire a deeper understanding of game dynamics. {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} highlighted that {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s user-friendly interface makes it accessible even to those who are not tech-savvy, enhancing the overall viewing experience. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} also offers customizable features, allowing users to personalize their experience by selecting which statistics and tracking data to display during a game. Users can choose from a variety of data points, such as player speed, shooting accuracy, and defensive metrics, to tailor the information to their preferences. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} development received support from the {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, which provided grants to promote technological advancements in sports entertainment. The {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, established to foster innovation in sports technology, has previously supported projects that enhance fan engagement and athlete performance. Celebrations held at {Techville|LOCATION-1}'s {City Sports Arena|BUILDING-2} saw local basketball teams utilize {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to analyze upcoming opponents, adding a layer of strategic benefit to the app. Teams like the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} and the {Techville Tigers|ORGANIZATION-4} used {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to study opponent strategies and player tendencies, gaining insights that could influence game plans. Despite initial excitement, some critics, like tech analyst {Liam Greene|PERSON-4}, warned that over-reliance on the app might distract viewers from the live action, urging balanced use during broadcasts. {Liam Greene|PERSON-4} suggested that while {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} offers valuable insights, viewers should be mindful not to let the digital overlays overshadow the live game experience. Following the launch, {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} announced an upcoming partnership with local sports bars in {Techville|LOCATION-1} to offer live demo experiences, aiming to broaden the app's user base. The partnership includes a series of promotional events where patrons can try {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} for free, with the goal of increasing its adoption among sports enthusiasts in the community.</outline></event>",
      "<event><date>2025-05-10</date><outline>The {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} held their first practice session utilizing {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} at {Techville Sports Complex|BUILDING-3} for analyzing offensive plays.

The drill included the use of {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s real-time statistical feedback to adjust shooting approaches, although the technical setup required some time for players to acclimate. Players had to familiarize themselves with the interface, which involved learning to interpret the overlay data without disrupting their natural gameplay rhythm. Team psychologist {Dr. Emma Fields|PERSON-8} mentioned the mental adjustment required for players to balance reliance on digital tools with their intuitive gameplay strategies. {Dr. Emma Fields|PERSON-8}, who has been working with the team to enhance their mental resilience, highlighted the importance of maintaining focus amidst the influx of digital information. Meanwhile, assistant coach {Lara Thompson|PERSON-9} worked on integrating {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s analytics into the team's existing strategy by combining player-tracking data with live coaching feedback. {Lara Thompson|PERSON-9}, known for her analytical approach to coaching, was developing a hybrid strategy that leveraged both traditional coaching methods and {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s advanced analytics.

The {Innovator's Hall|BUILDING-1}, known for hosting cutting-edge technology unveilings, was filled with industry experts and media representatives eager to witness the latest innovation. The app, developed by a talented team led by {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, an augmented reality expert, is designed to enhance home viewers' experience during basketball games by overlaying real-time statistics and player tracking. {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, who holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on augmented reality, has previously worked on several high-profile projects in the tech industry. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} successfully integrates with existing televisions and smart glasses, allowing users to experience dynamic graphics and stats as interactive overlays during live basketball broadcasts. The integration process involves a simple plug-and-play setup, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of television models and popular smart glasses brands. During its public demonstration, competitor basketball enthusiast {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2} provided feedback, noting the seamless integration of player movement tracking and statistical overlays. {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2}, a well-known figure in the basketball community, praised the app for its accuracy in tracking player movements and the clarity of the statistical data presented. The app was praised by sports journalist {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} for its innovative approach to enriching at-home sports viewing, particularly for casual fans who desire a deeper understanding of game dynamics. {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} highlighted that {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s user-friendly interface makes it accessible even to those who are not tech-savvy, enhancing the overall viewing experience. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} also offers customizable features, allowing users to personalize their experience by selecting which statistics and tracking data to display during a game. Users can choose from a variety of data points, such as player speed, shooting accuracy, and defensive metrics, to tailor the information to their preferences. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} development received support from the {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, which provided grants to promote technological advancements in sports entertainment. The {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, established to foster innovation in sports technology, has previously supported projects that enhance fan engagement and athlete performance.

Despite initial excitement, some critics, like tech analyst {Liam Greene|PERSON-4}, warned that over-reliance on the app might distract viewers from the live action, urging balanced use during broadcasts. {Liam Greene|PERSON-4} suggested that while {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} offers valuable insights, viewers should be mindful not to let the digital overlays overshadow the live game experience. Following the launch, {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} announced an upcoming partnership with local sports bars in {Techville|LOCATION-1} to offer live demo experiences, aiming to broaden the app's user base.

The drill included the use of {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s real-time statistical feedback to adjust shooting approaches, although the technical setup required some time for players to acclimate. Players had to familiarize themselves with the interface, which involved learning to interpret the overlay data without disrupting their natural gameplay rhythm. Team psychologist {Dr. Emma Fields|PERSON-8} mentioned the mental adjustment required for players to balance reliance on digital tools with their intuitive gameplay strategies. {Dr. Emma Fields|PERSON-8}, who has been working with the team to enhance their mental resilience, highlighted the importance of maintaining focus amidst the influx of digital information.
