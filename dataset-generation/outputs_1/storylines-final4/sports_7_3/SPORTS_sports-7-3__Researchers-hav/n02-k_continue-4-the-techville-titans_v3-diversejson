  "instructions": "You are an AI tasked with creating fictional future news summaries based on provided information. Your goal is to generate plausible continuations of an existing narrative. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. First, you will be given known entities in this fictional world. These will be provided in the following format:\n<known_entities>\n{{LOCATIONS_XML}}\n{{PERSONS_XML}}\n{{ORGANIZATIONS_XML}}\n{{PRODUCTS_XML}}\n{{ARTS_XML}}\n{{EVENTS_XML}}\n{{BUILDINGS_XML}}\n{{MISCELLANEOUSS_XML}}\n</known_entities>\n\n2. Next, you will be provided with the history of events that have already occurred in this fictional world:\n\n<history>\n{{HISTORY_XML}}\n</history>\n\n3. Your task is to create {{NUMBER_SUMMARIES}} new summaries that describe future fictional events following the last event from the <history>. These new summaries should be consistent with the existing story and represent plausible continuations or developments of the original narrative.\n\n4. For each summary, create:\n   a. A summary text (a single concise sentence)\n   b. The date on which this fictional next event happens\n\n5. Before starting, check if the history of events indicates specific dates for followup events. Ensure your continuations are consistent with these expected followup events. All your summaries must either concern this event, or happen before this event.\n\n6. Make sure that each summary you generate focuses on at least one of the main named entities from the history of events.\n\n7. Follow these guidelines when creating your summaries:\n   a. Ensure all summaries are fictional and not based on real events or real people.\n   b. Make the summaries sound realistic and plausible as follow-up stories to the previous outlines. \n   c. Think about plausible next events based on the fictional named entities, the history of the past fictional events and the genre {{GENRE}}. \n   d. Create summaries that are unbiased and objective in tone.\n   e. Each summary MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   f. Summaries may focus on different personas or organizations from the provided lists.\n   g. Ensure a balance of positive and negative news stories, developments, and alternative scenarios.\n   h. Consider various dimensions or personas that could be varied when generating diverse summaries.\n\nTry to be diverse in the summaries you generate. Consider different plausible substories and vary:\n- between impact: Try to create various low-impact next events, but you may also at times mix in an event with a slightly higher impact.\n- between directions: Vary between positive and negative story developments. Think about how stories in the {{GENRE}} genre progress in the real-world, NOT in a novel. Provide various realistic alternatives for how the story may progress in either direction.\n- between different key named entities of the fictional story.\n\n8. Output format:\n   - Enclose each summary in <summary> tags.\n   - Each summary must have two child properties:\n     <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n     <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n   - Before each summary, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Output everything within a <results> root node.\n\n9. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre {{GENRE}} AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre {{GENRE}}.\n\n10. Final reminders:\n   - Repeat this process for all {{NUMBER_SUMMARIES}} summaries.\n   - Ensure that each summary explores a different aspect or potential next step of the fictional situation presented in the HISTORY.\n   - Each summary text MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   - The continuations should be diverse in terms of high (at most one), medium and low impact, positive and negative story developments, etc., and can cover different alternatives of how the future event can play out.\n   - Do not enumerate over the summaries.\n   - When brainstorming future event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre {{GENRE}}. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event summaries while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative.\n\nHere's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[This includes the thought process for all summaries.]\n</thought_process>\n\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[Your first summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the first summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n<summary>\n<text>[Your second summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the second summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n[... continue for all summaries ...]\n</summaries>\n</results>",

The {Innovator's Hall|BUILDING-1}, known for hosting cutting-edge technology unveilings, was filled with industry experts and media representatives eager to witness the latest innovation. The app, developed by a talented team led by {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, an augmented reality expert, is designed to enhance home viewers' experience during basketball games by overlaying real-time statistics and player tracking. {Sarah Carson|PERSON-1}, who holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on augmented reality, has previously worked on several high-profile projects in the tech industry. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} successfully integrates with existing televisions and smart glasses, allowing users to experience dynamic graphics and stats as interactive overlays during live basketball broadcasts. The integration process involves a simple plug-and-play setup, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of television models and popular smart glasses brands. During its public demonstration, competitor basketball enthusiast {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2} provided feedback, noting the seamless integration of player movement tracking and statistical overlays. {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2}, a well-known figure in the basketball community, praised the app for its accuracy in tracking player movements and the clarity of the statistical data presented. The app was praised by sports journalist {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} for its innovative approach to enriching at-home sports viewing, particularly for casual fans who desire a deeper understanding of game dynamics. {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} highlighted that {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s user-friendly interface makes it accessible even to those who are not tech-savvy, enhancing the overall viewing experience. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} also offers customizable features, allowing users to personalize their experience by selecting which statistics and tracking data to display during a game. Users can choose from a variety of data points, such as player speed, shooting accuracy, and defensive metrics, to tailor the information to their preferences. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} development received support from the {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, which provided grants to promote technological advancements in sports entertainment. The {Sports Innovation Fund|ORGANIZATION-2}, established to foster innovation in sports technology, has previously supported projects that enhance fan engagement and athlete performance. Celebrations held at {Techville|LOCATION-1}'s {City Sports Arena|BUILDING-2} saw local basketball teams utilize {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to analyze upcoming opponents, adding a layer of strategic benefit to the app. Teams like the {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} and the {Techville Tigers|ORGANIZATION-4} used {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} to study opponent strategies and player tendencies, gaining insights that could influence game plans. Despite initial excitement, some critics, like tech analyst {Liam Greene|PERSON-4}, warned that over-reliance on the app might distract viewers from the live action, urging balanced use during broadcasts. {Liam Greene|PERSON-4} suggested that while {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} offers valuable insights, viewers should be mindful not to let the digital overlays overshadow the live game experience. Following the launch, {Celerisoft Inc.|ORGANIZATION-1} announced an upcoming partnership with local sports bars in {Techville|LOCATION-1} to offer live demo experiences, aiming to broaden the app's user base. The partnership includes a series of promotional events where patrons can try {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} for free, with the goal of increasing its adoption among sports enthusiasts in the community.</outline></event>\n<event><date>2025-05-10</date><outline>The {Techville Titans|ORGANIZATION-3} held their first practice session utilizing {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} at {Techville Sports Complex|BUILDING-3} for analyzing offensive plays. The {Techville Sports Complex|BUILDING-3}, known for its state-of-the-art facilities, provided an ideal environment for integrating advanced technology like {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} into the team's practice routines.

Defensive coordinator {Kevin Smith|PERSON-7} remained cautious, emphasizing that real game scenarios would be the true test for {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s effectiveness in enhancing plays. {Kevin Smith|PERSON-7}, who has a reputation for his strategic defensive setups, suggested that the team should focus on integrating {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s insights with their existing defensive drills. The drill included the use of {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s real-time statistical feedback to adjust shooting approaches, although the technical setup required some time for players to acclimate. Players had to familiarize themselves with the interface, which involved learning to interpret the overlay data without disrupting their natural gameplay rhythm. Team psychologist {Dr. Emma Fields|PERSON-8} mentioned the mental adjustment required for players to balance reliance on digital tools with their intuitive gameplay strategies. {Dr. Emma Fields|PERSON-8}, who has been working with the team to enhance their mental resilience, highlighted the importance of maintaining focus amidst the influx of digital information. Meanwhile, assistant coach {Lara Thompson|PERSON-9} worked on integrating {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s analytics into the team's existing strategy by combining player-tracking data with live coaching feedback. {Lara Thompson|PERSON-9}, known for her analytical approach to coaching, was developing a hybrid strategy that leveraged both traditional coaching methods and {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s advanced analytics.

Your task is to create 4 new summaries that describe future fictional events following the last event from the <history>. These new summaries should be consistent with the existing story and represent plausible continuations or developments of the original narrative.\n\n4. For each summary, create:\n   a. A summary text (a single concise sentence)\n   b. The date on which this fictional next event happens\n\n5. Before starting, check if the history of events indicates specific dates for followup events. Ensure your continuations are consistent with these expected followup events. All your summaries must either concern this event, or happen before this event.\n\n6. Make sure that each summary you generate focuses on at least one of the main named entities from the history of events.\n\n7. Follow these guidelines when creating your summaries:\n   a. Ensure all summaries are fictional and not based on real events or real people.\n   b. Make the summaries sound realistic and plausible as follow-up stories to the previous outlines. \n   c. Think about plausible next events based on the fictional named entities, the history of the past fictional events and the genre Sports. \n   d. Create summaries that are unbiased and objective in tone.\n   e. Each summary MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   f. Summaries may focus on different personas or organizations from the provided lists.\n   g. Ensure a balance of positive and negative news stories, developments, and alternative scenarios.\n   h. Consider various dimensions or personas that could be varied when generating diverse summaries.\n\nTry to be diverse in the summaries you generate. Consider different plausible substories and vary:\n- between impact: Try to create various low-impact next events, but you may also at times mix in an event with a slightly higher impact.\n- between directions: Vary between positive and negative story developments. Think about how stories in the Sports genre progress in the real-world, NOT in a novel. Provide various realistic alternatives for how the story may progress in either direction.\n- between different key named entities of the fictional story.\n\n8. Output format:\n   - Enclose each summary in <summary> tags.\n   - Each summary must have two child properties:\n     <text>[The generated summary]</text>\n     <date>[The date for the next event]</date>\n   - Before each summary, explain your thought process in <thought_process> tags. Make sure to identify all known followup events based on the provided history first, and verify that your continuations are consistent with these known followup events regarding the date.\n   - Output everything within a <results> root node.\n\n9. Special instructions:\n   - The history and entities have special formatting. They sometimes include statements like {[PHRASE]|[ID]}. Read it as [PHRASE], while the [ID] specifies the ID of the linked entity.\n   - Example: \"I met {Boris Bowman|PERSON-1} yesterday.\" Read as: \"I met Boris Bowman yesterday.\" (The ID of Boris Bowman is PERSON-1).\n   - DO NOT use the {[PHRASE]|[ID]} formulation when generating new summaries.\n   - Do not exaggerate the summaries. Avoid using words like \"groundbreaking\", \"worldwide\", \"global\". Keep the summaries realistic.\n   - Do not create summaries with global or national impact unless the genre specifically requires it. Instead, focus on smaller or local developments.\n   - Do not focus on technological discoveries or topics like AI tools, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-modelling, quantum computing, etc. You may include such topics only if they are HIGHLY relevant to the genre Sports AND the provided history of events.\n   - Focus on realistic, meaningful summaries with specific details and developments that align with typical, realistic scenarios of the genre Sports.\n\n10. Final reminders:\n   - Repeat this process for all 4 summaries.\n   - Ensure that each summary explores a different aspect or potential next step of the fictional situation presented in the HISTORY.\n   - Each summary text MUST BE ONLY A SINGLE concise sentence.\n   - The continuations should be diverse in terms of high (at most one), medium and low impact, positive and negative story developments, etc., and can cover different alternatives of how the future event can play out.\n   - Do not enumerate over the summaries.\n   - When brainstorming future event summaries, carefully consider whether each continuation aligns with the provided history of events, provided named entities, and the genre Sports. Before creating summaries with global or large-scale impact, double-check if such developments seem plausible based on how real-world events of this type would typically unfold. Focus on what fits the genre and provided history, ensuring that every dimension feels realistic and consistent with the context.\n\nRemember to maintain the desired format and brevity of the event summaries while creating plausible and engaging continuations of the narrative.\n\nHere's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<results>\n<thought_process>\n[This includes the thought process for all summaries.]\n</thought_process>\n\n<summaries>\n<summary>\n<text>[Your first summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the first summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n<summary>\n<text>[Your second summary text here]</text>\n<date>[Date for the second summary]</date>\n</summary>\n\n[... continue for all summaries ...]\n</summaries>\n</results>",

During its public demonstration, competitor basketball enthusiast {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2} provided feedback, noting the seamless integration of player movement tracking and statistical overlays. {Jonathan Mills|PERSON-2}, a well-known figure in the basketball community, praised the app for its accuracy in tracking player movements and the clarity of the statistical data presented. The app was praised by sports journalist {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} for its innovative approach to enriching at-home sports viewing, particularly for casual fans who desire a deeper understanding of game dynamics. {Mia Thompson|PERSON-3} highlighted that {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1}'s user-friendly interface makes it accessible even to those who are not tech-savvy, enhancing the overall viewing experience. {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} also offers customizable features, allowing users to personalize their experience by selecting which statistics and tracking data to display during a game.

Despite initial excitement, some critics, like tech analyst {Liam Greene|PERSON-4}, warned that over-reliance on the app might distract viewers from the live action, urging balanced use during broadcasts. {Liam Greene|PERSON-4} suggested that while {HoloCourt|PRODUCT-1} offers valuable insights, viewers should be mindful not to let the digital overlays overshadow the live game experience.
