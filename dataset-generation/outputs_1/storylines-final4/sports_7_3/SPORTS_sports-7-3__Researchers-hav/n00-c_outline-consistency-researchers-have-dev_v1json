Their roles should be consistent with any previous mentions.\n- **PRODUCTS:** HoloCourt is the new product being unveiled.\n- **BUILDINGS:** Innovator's Hall and City Sports Arena are used as venues.\n- **MISCELLANEOUS:** Techville Titans and Techville Tigers are local basketball teams.\n\n### Step 3: Note Changes to Known Named Entities\n\n- If any of these entities were previously mentioned in the history, their roles or characteristics should be consistent with the outline.\n- Changes to entities are acceptable if they are reasonably discussed within the outline.\n\n### Step 4: Identify and Resolve Inconsistencies\n\nSince the history is not provided, I will assume no direct contradictions exist. However, if any inconsistencies were found, they would be resolved by making minimal changes to the outline while maintaining its structure and flow.\n\n### Step 5: Output the Results\n\nAssuming no inconsistencies were found, the outline remains unchanged.
