We assume both actions occurred on their event dates; since both event dates are 2025-08-29, both actions are assumed to have occurred on the same calendar day.\n- We assume no implicit earlier/later ordering within the day can be established from the sentences, so the duration in whole days is 0 days.\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Signing/announcement (N0-S0): 2025-08-29 (assumed from the sentence's event date).\n- Supervised full-contact training completion (N1-S0): 2025-08-29 (explicitly stated).\n\nAdditional sentences:\n- None added.

Without N1-S0's explicit date the question cannot be answered; without N0-S0 the start point is missing. Both sentences are necessary.\n- Make the question avoid citing the absolute date; include an explicit assumption clause that the reader should use the event date for the sentence that lacks an explicit date.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Signing/announcement date (from N0-S0 event date) = 2025-08-29 (assumed).\n- Training completion date (from N1-S0) = 2025-08-29.\n- Difference = 2025-08-29 \u2212 2025-08-29 = 0 days.\n</scratchpad>", "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the previous response and compared it to the task instructions.\n\nFindings:\n- The original response correctly identified dates, made explicit assumptions, derived the absolute dates, computed the duration (0 days), and formed a question that avoided stating absolute dates.

The outline associates N0 with 2025-08-29, so we take that as the signing/announcement date.\n- The one-year contract extension runs for exactly one calendar year from the signing/announcement date (i.e., from the signing date up to the same month/day one year later). This is the natural interpretation of a \"one-year\" extension for computing an absolute end date.\n- The pre-match physical assessment recorded in N2-S0 occurred on 2025-08-29 and is therefore the reference start point for the interval.\n\nAbsolute dates (based on assumptions):\n- Signing/announcement date (start of extension): 2025-08-29 (from N0-S0 event date)\n- Contract expiration date (one year later): 2026-08-29 (one-year after 2025-08-29)\n- Pre-match assessment date: 2025-08-29 (from N2-S0)\n\nReasoning:\n- The question will ask for the time span between the pre-match assessment (the recorded swelling) and the expiration of the one-year extension that was signed/announced on the same day.\n- Both sentences are required: N2-S0 gives the assessment date; N0-S0 gives the one-year contract length and the fact it was announced/signed (we need its date taken from N0's event date). Without N0-S0 we wouldn't know the contract duration; without N2-S0 we wouldn't know the assessment date.\n\nAnswer derivation:\n- Start = date of pre-match assessment = 2025-08-29.\n- End = contract end = signing date + 1 year = 2026-08-29.\n- Duration = from 2025-08-29 to 2026-08-29 = 1 year.\n- In days (2026 is not a leap year): 365 days.\n\nQuestion framing note:\n- The question will avoid explicit dates and instead state the necessary assumption: that the one-year extension begins on the day the club announced it and that the pre-match assessment occurred on that same day.

No clock time given.\n- Event date: 2025-08-29 (event containing N0-S0).\n\nN3-S9:\n- Time information: The one-week functional review was booked for 09:00 on 2025-09-06 at Harborfen Diagnostic Centre.\n- Event date: 2025-08-30 (event containing N3-S9), but the sentence itself contains an absolute date 2025-09-06 at 09:00.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The announcement described in N0-S0 occurred on the event date for that sentence (2025-08-29). No specific time-of-day is given for the announcement; because the question will ask for elapsed days, we treat the announcement as occurring at some time on 2025-08-29 and compute whole-day difference to the scheduled review on 2025-09-06 at 09:00. This yields an integer number of days between the two calendar dates (ignoring hours/minutes within the start date).\n- We assume no other offset (e.g., time zones) is relevant.\n\nAbsolute dates:\n- Start: 2025-08-29 (date of announcement per N0-S0 event date).\n- End: 2025-09-06 09:00 (appointment per N3-S9).\n\nDerivation:\n- Count days from 2025-08-29 to 2025-09-06:\n  - 2025-08-29 \u2192 2025-08-30 = 1 day\n  - \u2192 2025-08-31 = 2 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-01 = 3 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-02 = 4 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-03 = 5 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-04 = 6 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-05 = 7 days\n  - \u2192 2025-09-06 = 8 days\n- Therefore, 8 days elapsed between the announcement date (2025-08-29) and the calendar date of the booked review (2025-09-06). (If hours were counted from a precise announcement time on 2025-08-29, the duration would be 8 days plus some hours; because no time-of-day is specified for the announcement, the integer-day answer is 8 days.)\n\nQuestion Idea:\n- Ask for the number of days elapsed between the club's announcement of the one-year contract extension (N0-S0) and the scheduled one-week functional review appointment (N3-S9), while explicitly stating the assumption that the announcement happened on the day given in its event.\n- Unique required info:\n  - From N0-S0: the fact and date (event date) of the announcement (start point).\n  - From N3-S9: the scheduled appointment date/time (end point).\n- Both sentences are necessary: N0-S0 supplies the start date, N3-S9 supplies the end date/time. No other sentence in the outline provides both pieces together.\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- Start date = 2025-08-29 (N0-S0 event date)\n- End date = 2025-09-06 (N3-S9)\n- Difference = 8 days\n</scratchpad>", "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.\n\nFindings:\n- The original answer correctly identified the start and end dates (start = event date of N0-S0 = 2025-08-29; end = date/time given in N3-S9 = 09:00 on 2025-09-06) and computed the elapsed calendar days as 8 days.\n- The question avoided stating absolute dates directly and included the necessary assumption that the announcement occurred on the event date for N0-S0.\n- The original output included a scratchpad derivation and a results block with a QA pair, as required.\n- One minor omission: the previous \"additional_sentence_ids\" field was left empty even though the meta-check output now requests listing the selected sentence IDs (and any additional ones).

The question must be answered by combining the date from N1-S0 (to anchor the session to that day) and the length from N1-S1. Frame the question so the reader must extract that the session was completed \"that day\" (N1-S0) and that the session lasted approximately 75 minutes (N1-S1).\n\n[Answer derivation]:\n- From N1-S1: session duration = approximately 75 minutes.\n- N1-S0 anchors the session to 2025-08-29; under the assumption the session started and ended on that date, the time-span from session start to session end = 75 minutes.\n\n</scratchpad>", "scratchpad2": "<scratchpad>\nI reviewed the previous response against the task instructions.\n\nFindings:\n- The previous response correctly identified the time information in N1-S0 (absolute date) and N1-S1 (duration), made a reasonable assumption (session started and ended same day), derived the duration (75 minutes), and produced a clear question and concise answer (\"75 minutes\").\n- The previous response included a detailed <scratchpad> reasoning and derivation, and the question included the required assumption.\n- However, the <results> block omitted listing the selected sentence IDs under <additional_sentence_ids>.
